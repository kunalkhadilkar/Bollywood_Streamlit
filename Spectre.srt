2
00:03:52,434 --> 00:03:54,186
Where are you going?

3
00:03:56,088 --> 00:03:57,739
I won't be long.

4
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:55,958
Bottoms up.

5
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:50,103
Meet me at the square!
Meet me at the square!

6
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,342
Start anywhere you like.

7
00:16:46,303 --> 00:16:49,006
Take your time, 007.
But in 5 minutes,

8
00:16:49,106 --> 00:16:50,878
the head of the joint security service
is going to walk through that door

9
00:16:50,978 --> 00:16:54,161
and I got to explain to him,
how one of our agents decided to porter off

10
00:16:54,261 --> 00:16:57,685
to Mexico all on his own
and caused an international incident.

11
00:16:57,785 --> 00:16:59,830
With all due respect, sir,
it could have been worse.

12
00:16:59,842 --> 00:17:00,527
Worse?

13
00:17:00,628 --> 00:17:02,169
You blew up half a bloody block.

14
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:04,722
Well, better half a block than
a whole stadium full of people.

15
00:17:04,822 --> 00:17:06,413
You had no authority.

16
00:17:07,595 --> 00:17:08,706
None.

17
00:17:08,906 --> 00:17:10,549
As you know, we're in the
middle of the biggest

18
00:17:10,561 --> 00:17:12,249
shake up in the history
of British intelligence.

19
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:15,973
The inks barely dry on this merger with MI5
and already they are itching for a chance

20
00:17:16,173 --> 00:17:20,157
to scrap the 00 program forever.
And you just given them one.

21
00:17:21,218 --> 00:17:25,443
You are right, sir.
You have got a tricky day ahead.

22
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:31,278
This is an official question.

23
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,713
Mexico city,
what were you doing there?

24
00:17:36,544 --> 00:17:40,278
It's just a coincidence.
I was taking some overdue holiday.

25
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,681
Okay. Fine.

26
00:17:43,881 --> 00:17:46,424
As of this morning,
you are officially grounded.

27
00:17:46,794 --> 00:17:50,528
I'm standing you down
from all operations indefinitely.

28
00:17:58,386 --> 00:17:59,997
Very good, sir.

29
00:18:01,018 --> 00:18:02,440
007

30
00:18:03,771 --> 00:18:04,653
Sir?

31
00:18:04,665 --> 00:18:07,345
I don't know what you are
playing, but whatever it is

32
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,127
it has to stop...

33
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:11,299
now.

34
00:18:13,191 --> 00:18:15,253
- So sorry, am I interrupting?
- Not remotely.

35
00:18:15,453 --> 00:18:18,836
007, I'd like you to meet Max Denbigh,
head of the joint security service.

36
00:18:18,976 --> 00:18:21,449
Well, it's a pleasure to finally meet
you, 007. I heard a lot about you.

37
00:18:21,649 --> 00:18:24,792
- Most of it is good.
- Congratulations on your new appointment.

38
00:18:24,832 --> 00:18:27,095
Thank you.
Suppose we should call you C, now.

39
00:18:27,295 --> 00:18:30,939
- No, no. Max, please.
- No, I think I'll call you, C.

40
00:18:31,689 --> 00:18:34,132
- C.
- As you wish.

41
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:38,846
Well, my door is always open, 007
for my employees.

42
00:18:39,667 --> 00:18:41,789
This merger is going to be
a whole new chapter for us.

43
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:47,175
We're going to bring British intelligence
out of the dark ages into the light.

44
00:18:48,977 --> 00:18:51,679
- That all sounds lovely.
- That will be all, 007.

45
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,102
Report to Q tomorrow
for medical, thank you.

46
00:18:54,372 --> 00:18:55,583
Very good, sir.

47
00:19:05,533 --> 00:19:06,765
James.

48
00:19:07,005 --> 00:19:08,536
Moneypenny.

49
00:19:09,177 --> 00:19:11,750
- So, how was the meeting?
- Very good, thank you.

50
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:15,323
Here, forensics finally released this.

51
00:19:15,563 --> 00:19:16,360
What is it?

52
00:19:16,372 --> 00:19:18,797
It's personal effects they
recovered from Sky-fall.

53
00:19:18,997 --> 00:19:20,849
Perfect.
You can bring it to me later.

54
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:23,331
- What do you mean?
- My place, 9 o'clock.

55
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:38,226
- Evening.
- Come in.

56
00:19:40,418 --> 00:19:42,100
Have you just moved in?

57
00:19:42,861 --> 00:19:43,563
No.

58
00:19:43,575 --> 00:19:45,714
Well, I like what you've
done with the place.

59
00:19:47,446 --> 00:19:48,987
Your delivery.

60
00:19:49,878 --> 00:19:50,929
Thank you.

61
00:19:54,663 --> 00:19:57,265
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thanks. I'm not staying.

62
00:19:57,285 --> 00:19:58,797
It's a shame.

63
00:19:59,287 --> 00:20:00,989
What's going on, James?

64
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:04,833
There's not one person in MI6
who isn't talking about it.

65
00:20:05,694 --> 00:20:08,387
Talking about what, exactly?

66
00:20:09,298 --> 00:20:12,481
That what you did in Mexico
was one step too far.

67
00:20:12,941 --> 00:20:14,813
That you're finished.

68
00:20:15,023 --> 00:20:18,967
- What do you think?
- I think you're just getting started.

69
00:20:20,449 --> 00:20:23,552
- I don't know what you mean.
- Fine

70
00:20:24,893 --> 00:20:27,075
I think you've got a secret.

71
00:20:27,946 --> 00:20:30,179
And it's something you won't tell anyone.

72
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,942
Because you don't trust anyone.

73
00:20:44,413 --> 00:20:47,997
If anything happens to me for some reason.
I need you to you to do something.

74
00:20:48,717 --> 00:20:52,321
Find a man called Marco Sciarra.

75
00:20:53,262 --> 00:20:57,036
Kill him.
And don't miss the funeral.

76
00:21:00,699 --> 00:21:06,685
- Jesus! Where did you get it?
- From my mailbox just after she died.

77
00:21:07,716 --> 00:21:10,379
She was never short of surprises.

78
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:14,173
Wasn't gonna let death get
in the way of her job.

79
00:21:15,144 --> 00:21:19,348
- I've been tracking Sciarra ever since.
- And what have you found?

80
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:22,011
Nothing significant, yet.

81
00:21:22,091 --> 00:21:26,555
- When's the funeral?
- Three days. In Rome.

82
00:21:26,906 --> 00:21:29,538
If you think M's signing off for that,
you're insane!

83
00:21:29,658 --> 00:21:32,882
- He won't let you out of his sight.
- Yes, that's a bit of a problem.

84
00:21:33,462 --> 00:21:38,187
Listen, could you do a little
quiet digging for me?

85
00:21:38,567 --> 00:21:41,160
I heard a name in Mexico,
The Pale King.

86
00:21:43,633 --> 00:21:46,145
You want me to be your mole!

87
00:21:47,777 --> 00:21:49,348
Yes.

88
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:53,382
What makes you think you can trust me?

89
00:21:56,055 --> 00:21:57,717
Instinct.

90
00:22:19,749 --> 00:22:22,372
ORDER of TEMPORARY GUARDIANSHIP.

91
00:22:57,807 --> 00:22:59,449
Poor old girl.

92
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:01,681
Rigged the demolition in a week.

93
00:23:02,322 --> 00:23:05,034
Cheaper to knock her down, than
to rebuild.

94
00:23:05,795 --> 00:23:08,798
Still, "Iron waits for no man"
and all that.

95
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,532
Anyway, all the money's been spent on this.

96
00:23:14,094 --> 00:23:17,067
The New Center for National Security!

97
00:23:18,778 --> 00:23:21,781
- So, that's C's new digs.
- You've met him, have you?

98
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:26,736
- Yesterday, what do we know about it?
- Perfect Whitehall Mandarin.

99
00:23:27,147 --> 00:23:30,991
Wrote a dossier last year about how the
00 program was obsolete.

100
00:23:31,021 --> 00:23:33,183
How drones could do our dirty work abroad.

101
00:23:33,683 --> 00:23:36,666
- Went to school with our Home Secretary.
- Of course he did!

102
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:39,129
This murder's just the start of it.

103
00:23:39,449 --> 00:23:41,711
Three days, there's a security
conference in Tokyo

104
00:23:41,721 --> 00:23:44,164
to decide the New World Order.

105
00:23:44,174 --> 00:23:45,495
If he gets his ways,

106
00:23:45,515 --> 00:23:47,767
He'll have unlimited access to the
combined intelligence streams

107
00:23:47,768 --> 00:23:49,179
of nine countries.

108
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:52,302
- Including us.
- Right.

109
00:24:00,901 --> 00:24:03,263
Well, lots happened when you were away.

110
00:24:03,423 --> 00:24:04,614
Train bombing in Hamburg

111
00:24:04,634 --> 00:24:07,477
and an industrial explosion
in Tunisia.

112
00:24:07,597 --> 00:24:11,271
Not great timing for us,
we're rather playing into C's hands.

113
00:24:12,082 --> 00:24:15,977
M, well, let's say he's
feeling the pressure.

114
00:24:15,989 --> 00:24:17,698
Yeah, I've noticed.

115
00:24:18,068 --> 00:24:21,401
This way, 007. Be careful,
it's quite slippery.

116
00:24:24,935 --> 00:24:28,519
Q wasn't exactly feeling at home in
Whitehall up with the new merger so,

117
00:24:28,659 --> 00:24:32,493
He set up a shop here, away
from prying eyes as it were.

118
00:24:32,683 --> 00:24:35,486
I hear he's get something rather
special planned for you.

119
00:24:35,496 --> 00:24:37,237
I can hardly wait.

120
00:24:47,908 --> 00:24:51,081
- Ah, 007.
- Q.

121
00:24:51,552 --> 00:24:53,344
Please excuse the mess.
Lots of things were a

122
00:24:53,356 --> 00:24:55,356
little bit up in the air
with the changes and all.

123
00:24:55,626 --> 00:24:57,558
Couple of things to get through.

124
00:24:59,199 --> 00:25:00,891
Shall we get started?

125
00:25:01,201 --> 00:25:02,853
Just relax.

126
00:25:04,655 --> 00:25:05,806
That's it, lovely.

127
00:25:05,886 --> 00:25:08,729
- Now, you may feel a small...
- Christ!

128
00:25:09,169 --> 00:25:10,961
Prick.

129
00:25:12,223 --> 00:25:14,885
- What is it?
- Cutting edge nano technology.

130
00:25:15,616 --> 00:25:20,050
Smart Blood.
Microchips in your bloodstream.

131
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:22,703
Allows us to track your movements
in the field.

132
00:25:23,874 --> 00:25:25,666
You see those read-outs?

133
00:25:25,756 --> 00:25:28,689
We can monitor your vital signs
from anywhere on the planet.

134
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:30,861
This is marvelous

135
00:25:31,872 --> 00:25:36,267
I call it the Post-Mexico insurance
policy, by direct order then.

136
00:25:38,289 --> 00:25:39,990
I completely understand.

137
00:25:41,882 --> 00:25:42,933
Good.

138
00:25:44,805 --> 00:25:49,630
Well I've just um... One last thing
and you could be on your way.

139
00:25:56,457 --> 00:25:58,599
Magnificent isn't she?

140
00:25:58,859 --> 00:26:01,222
0 to 60 in 3.2 seconds.

141
00:26:01,252 --> 00:26:04,345
Fully bulletproof, few little
tricks up her sleeve.

142
00:26:05,756 --> 00:26:08,319
Shame really, she was meant
for you but she...

143
00:26:08,349 --> 00:26:10,761
been reassigned to 009.

144
00:26:11,512 --> 00:26:13,494
But you can have this.

145
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:22,463
- Does it do anything?
- It tells the time.

146
00:26:22,994 --> 00:26:24,716
Might cope with your punctuality issue.

147
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:26,988
- M's idea?
- Precisely.

148
00:26:27,979 --> 00:26:29,741
Oh, one word of warning.

149
00:26:29,811 --> 00:26:34,525
The alarm is rather loud.
If you know what I mean.

150
00:26:34,545 --> 00:26:36,257
Like I do?

151
00:26:42,063 --> 00:26:42,904
Oh, yes.

152
00:26:42,954 --> 00:26:45,146
That odd thing is taking
quite a bit of time.

153
00:26:45,777 --> 00:26:49,821
Mind you there wasn't much left to work on.
Only a steering wheel.

154
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:54,045
I believe I said "Bring it back in one
piece", not "Bring back one piece."

155
00:26:59,601 --> 00:27:02,474
Anyway, enjoy your downtime, 007.

156
00:27:04,606 --> 00:27:06,608
- Q.
- Yes?

157
00:27:07,218 --> 00:27:11,122
Well now you know exactly where
I am, all the time.

158
00:27:12,143 --> 00:27:13,855
Would you do something for me?

159
00:27:13,985 --> 00:27:16,157
What do you have in mind exactly?

160
00:27:17,529 --> 00:27:19,521
Make me disappear.

161
00:27:21,543 --> 00:27:25,216
Um, may I remind you.
That I answer directly to M.

162
00:27:25,637 --> 00:27:28,027
I also have a mortgage
and 2 cats to feed.

163
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:29,040
Oh.

164
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:31,152
Then I suggest you trust me.

165
00:27:32,073 --> 00:27:33,875
Think of the cats.

166
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:41,223
Well it's lovely to see you, 007.
Lovely.

167
00:27:41,353 --> 00:27:42,894
No, I'm meant to tell you.

168
00:27:42,924 --> 00:27:46,658
The Smart Blood program is still
in its developmental phrase.

169
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:52,354
So, we may experience the odd drop
in coverage during the first 24 hours.

170
00:27:54,015 --> 00:28:00,001
48 hours after administration.
After that it should work perfectly.

171
00:28:00,572 --> 00:28:04,136
- I'll send you a postcard.
- Please don't.

172
00:28:25,427 --> 00:28:27,019
Thank you J.

173
00:28:33,255 --> 00:28:37,329
- Morning, what's that?
- Oh, just something from an admirer.

174
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:40,202
No, sir.

175
00:28:41,213 --> 00:28:43,455
That was last week.

176
00:28:43,675 --> 00:28:47,519
Morning, 009 has arrived to
pick up the DB10, sir.

177
00:28:47,629 --> 00:28:50,763
- He's waiting upstairs.
- Oh, good. Yes. Fine.

178
00:29:05,938 --> 00:29:07,770
Shit.

179
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:07,730
Sign of hope in the resurrection

180
00:31:11,254 --> 00:31:13,476
I'm sorry for your loss.

181
00:31:15,859 --> 00:31:18,862
- You knew my husband?
- Only briefly.

182
00:31:19,703 --> 00:31:23,226
- What did you do?
- Life insurance.

183
00:31:23,376 --> 00:31:27,220
- Probably too late for that.
- For your husband, yes.

184
00:31:28,161 --> 00:31:31,404
- What about you?
- Me?

185
00:31:31,725 --> 00:31:36,439
I hear the life expectancy of some
widows can be very short.

186
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:41,444
How can you talk like this?
Can't you see I'm grieving?

187
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:44,217
No.

188
00:34:03,798 --> 00:34:08,733
- What a lovely view.
- You're wasting your time.

189
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:12,246
There are a hundred more
that would come after me.

190
00:34:12,306 --> 00:34:16,170
All you buy me, is 5 minutes.

191
00:34:16,671 --> 00:34:20,274
Excellent, time for a drink.

192
00:34:30,064 --> 00:34:33,678
You killed him, didn't you?

193
00:34:33,898 --> 00:34:37,101
- My husband.
- He was an assassin.

194
00:34:37,592 --> 00:34:40,184
Trust me, he won't take it personally.

195
00:34:42,817 --> 00:34:46,711
You signed my death warrant.
I was respected.

196
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:50,014
- Loyal to a man you hated.
- He trusted my silence.

197
00:34:50,104 --> 00:34:53,588
With him gone, I'm a dead woman.
I can trust nobody.

198
00:34:53,608 --> 00:34:57,412
I know the feeling well - Well, I
can tell you the victim tries to...

199
00:34:57,452 --> 00:35:02,297
Then you have impeccable instincts - If
you don't leave now, we'll die together

200
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:07,352
I can think of worse ways to go.

201
00:35:08,403 --> 00:35:12,477
Then you're obviously crazy, Mr...

202
00:35:14,018 --> 00:35:15,510
Bond.

203
00:35:16,541 --> 00:35:19,494
James Bond.

204
00:35:28,423 --> 00:35:34,019
These people...
If you just knew what they could do.

205
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:37,652
The power they have.

206
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:41,166
Did you ever heard him mention
The Pale King?

207
00:35:42,077 --> 00:35:43,628
No.

208
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:47,332
The organization.

209
00:35:48,373 --> 00:35:50,815
They hardly ever meet.

210
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:56,001
But because what happened to my husband.

211
00:35:56,591 --> 00:35:59,574
- They meet tonight.
- Why?

212
00:35:59,995 --> 00:36:03,738
- To choose a replacement.
- Where?

213
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,582
La Pallazzo Cadenzza.

214
00:36:07,993 --> 00:36:11,606
- At nine.
- Sounds like fun, I might drop by.

215
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:15,210
He was obsessed.

216
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:18,503
Spend more time with them
than with me.

217
00:36:21,206 --> 00:36:23,478
Then, that man was a fool.

218
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:36,347
Leaving your number?

219
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:39,154
I'm calling an American
friend of mine, Felix.

220
00:36:40,055 --> 00:36:42,277
I'll contact his embassy,
get you out of here.

221
00:36:42,588 --> 00:36:44,560
You'll be safe.

222
00:36:51,907 --> 00:36:53,819
Don't go, James.

223
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:59,124
If you go there, you're crossing over
to a place where there is no mercy

224
00:36:59,274 --> 00:37:00,806
I have to go.

225
00:37:02,438 --> 00:37:05,421
Good luck, Mrs. Lucia.

226
00:37:53,179 --> 00:37:55,451
Hey, wait there.

227
00:37:56,032 --> 00:37:58,094
Identify yourself, ass hole.

228
00:37:59,105 --> 00:38:02,748
- Who are you?
- I'm Mickey Mouse, who are you?

229
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:06,122
Sorry.

230
00:38:31,457 --> 00:38:34,511
Well, the latest figures
show that presently

231
00:38:34,523 --> 00:38:37,113
control 70% of
antimalarial vaccines.

232
00:38:37,173 --> 00:38:44,901
34% on HIV and 40% of all ontological
drug across Sub-Saharan Africa.

233
00:38:47,253 --> 00:38:49,745
We've faced challenges from the
WHO and their campaign against

234
00:38:49,746 --> 00:38:49,739
against out counterfeit pharmaceuticals.
We've faced

235
00:38:49,751 --> 00:38:49,756
challenges from the WHO and
their campaign against

236
00:38:49,757 --> 00:38:52,088
against out counterfeit
pharmaceuticals.

237
00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:56,242
We have now identified the
key individuals to target.

238
00:38:56,833 --> 00:39:00,476
We expect the same success as we had
against the Council of Union Traffic.

239
00:39:01,367 --> 00:39:03,079
Dr. Vogel.

240
00:39:59,946 --> 00:40:02,639
Don't let me interrupt you.

241
00:40:28,485 --> 00:40:31,248
Now, onto the matter at hand.

242
00:40:31,378 --> 00:40:35,102
After our successful attack in
Hamburg and Tunisia.

243
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:37,914
We abort an attack on Mexico City and

244
00:40:37,915 --> 00:40:41,608
the death of our valued
colleague, Marco Sciarra.

245
00:40:41,748 --> 00:40:44,551
Leave one of his duty, outstanding.

246
00:40:45,122 --> 00:40:48,215
Señor Gerard, the Pale King
must be terminated.

247
00:40:48,926 --> 00:40:51,168
Will you make the journey to Attersee?

248
00:41:46,464 --> 00:41:50,622
Does anyone challenge Señor Guerra
for this position?

249
00:42:15,693 --> 00:42:16,694
Welcome.

250
00:42:16,964 --> 00:42:19,807
State your credentials
for succeeding, Señor Guerra.

251
00:43:13,892 --> 00:43:15,603
It's funny.

252
00:43:18,016 --> 00:43:22,440
All that excitement in Mexico City
rang a distant bell.

253
00:43:23,802 --> 00:43:30,068
And now, suddenly this
evening it makes perfect sense.

254
00:43:35,473 --> 00:43:37,856
Welcome, James.

255
00:43:41,089 --> 00:43:47,025
It's been a long time.
But finally here we are!

256
00:43:50,589 --> 00:43:53,181
What took you so long?

257
00:44:00,539 --> 00:44:01,880
Cuckoo.

258
00:44:04,823 --> 00:44:06,715
Ciao, Mickey Mouse!

259
00:45:25,654 --> 00:45:27,376
Are you kidding me?

260
00:45:45,594 --> 00:45:46,776
No!

261
00:46:26,485 --> 00:46:28,167
What are you doing?

262
00:46:54,554 --> 00:46:56,456
Moneypenny.

263
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,191
- Bond?
- Listen, Moneypenny.

264
00:47:02,211 --> 00:47:04,684
Hamburg, Tunisia, Mexico City,
they're all linked.

265
00:47:04,744 --> 00:47:07,597
It's one organization coordinating
multiple attacks.

266
00:47:07,657 --> 00:47:09,819
- So she was right.
- Of course she was.

267
00:47:10,059 --> 00:47:12,402
- I ran that check.
- Who is it?

268
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:17,587
My boss had his credit card stolen,
it's nothing.

269
00:47:17,757 --> 00:47:19,919
- Why don't you go back to sleep?
- Don't be long.

270
00:47:20,029 --> 00:47:21,831
- Who is that?
- No one.

271
00:47:21,941 --> 00:47:24,414
- No, it was.
- It's just a friend.

272
00:47:24,514 --> 00:47:27,487
At this time of night?
It's called life, James.

273
00:47:27,557 --> 00:47:29,629
You should try it sometime.

274
00:47:35,765 --> 00:47:38,878
The Pale King, it looks
like you've had dealings with him before.

275
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:41,771
- Quantum.
- Of course, Mr. White!

276
00:47:41,801 --> 00:47:42,842
That's him.

277
00:47:42,902 --> 00:47:47,207
Last unconfirmed sighting, Attersee
in Austria. Four months ago.

278
00:47:48,578 --> 00:47:50,270
Hold that thought.

279
00:48:02,262 --> 00:48:04,364
- You still there?
- Yeah.

280
00:48:04,404 --> 00:48:06,596
- Run another name, will you?
- Okay.

281
00:48:08,038 --> 00:48:11,241
A man called Franz Oberhauss.

282
00:48:13,653 --> 00:48:16,535
Check his files, before and after
his death.

283
00:48:16,536 --> 00:48:16,529
After his death? What
are you talking about?

284
00:48:16,541 --> 00:48:16,546
Check his files, before
and after his death.

285
00:48:16,547 --> 00:48:18,388
After his death?
What are you talking about?

286
00:48:18,408 --> 00:48:20,260
Please, just do it.

287
00:49:44,795 --> 00:49:47,968
Okay, Q. Give me something.

288
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:01,352
That's more like it.

289
00:50:07,108 --> 00:50:08,579
Here goes nothing.

290
00:50:44,796 --> 00:50:46,457
Good evening.

291
00:51:03,504 --> 00:51:05,947
Do not let them tell you,
we need less surveillance.

292
00:51:06,918 --> 00:51:07,999
We need more.

293
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:10,231
Much more.

294
00:51:10,732 --> 00:51:11,773
I say again. _.

295
00:51:11,793 --> 00:51:16,187
The 9 Eyes Committee will have
full access to the combined intelligence

296
00:51:16,197 --> 00:51:17,959
streams of all member states.

297
00:51:17,989 --> 00:51:20,081
More data, more analysis.

298
00:51:20,782 --> 00:51:23,985
Less likelihood of terrorist attacks.

299
00:51:24,586 --> 00:51:25,767
Ladies and gentlemen.

300
00:51:25,837 --> 00:51:29,410
It's time for the security services
of the world to unite.

301
00:51:30,191 --> 00:51:32,534
Alone, we are weak.

302
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:36,187
Together, we're a global power.

303
00:51:36,478 --> 00:51:38,359
An unelected one.

304
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,622
Thank you.

305
00:51:41,963 --> 00:51:43,094
Thank you.

306
00:51:43,815 --> 00:51:45,987
We will now vote on the resolution.

307
00:51:46,388 --> 00:51:48,850
Ladies and gentlemen,
please cast your votes.

308
00:51:54,546 --> 00:51:56,928
The vote is 8 to 1 in favour.

309
00:51:57,158 --> 00:52:01,993
However, as you know. We cannot proceed
unless the unanimous vote.

310
00:52:02,153 --> 00:52:04,806
The 9 Eyes notion,
is therefore, not passed.

311
00:52:05,667 --> 00:52:06,766
Democracy.

312
00:52:06,778 --> 00:52:10,111
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
This evening session is adjourned.

313
00:52:13,064 --> 00:52:14,996
ARE WE SURE BOND'S IN LONDON?

314
00:52:26,448 --> 00:52:29,491
- Yes, sir.
- Please tell me 007 is in London.

315
00:52:29,551 --> 00:52:31,303
Oh, yes. Um.

316
00:52:31,543 --> 00:52:33,625
I'll just take a look now, sir.

317
00:52:33,705 --> 00:52:35,547
Because if he isn't, you're
in deep shit.

318
00:52:37,229 --> 00:52:38,950
You've get precisely, 10 seconds.

319
00:52:43,225 --> 00:52:45,597
I have him, sir.
He appears to be in Chelsea.

320
00:52:46,068 --> 00:52:48,941
Well, I want eyes on him when
I get back. Understood?

321
00:52:49,721 --> 00:52:53,916
I completely understand... Sir..

322
00:55:46,790 --> 00:55:49,492
Do me a favour, make it quick.

323
00:55:49,693 --> 00:55:52,185
Upstairs, Mr. White.

324
00:56:01,925 --> 00:56:07,030
I always knew death would wear
a familiar face but not yours.

325
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:10,634
So to what do I owe this pleasure Mr. Bond?

326
00:56:12,616 --> 00:56:14,948
I was at a meeting recently.

327
00:56:15,148 --> 00:56:16,970
And your name came up.

328
00:56:17,170 --> 00:56:20,013
I'm flattered London
is still talking about me.

329
00:56:20,103 --> 00:56:24,117
It wasn't MI6. It was Rome.

330
00:56:25,168 --> 00:56:27,451
Your team, not mine.

331
00:56:33,176 --> 00:56:37,901
Last month, I found Thallium
in my cell phone.

332
00:56:37,911 --> 00:56:39,102
It's done its job.

333
00:56:39,122 --> 00:56:42,476
I have a few weeks. Maybe less.

334
00:56:44,638 --> 00:56:47,691
So, here we are, Mr. Bond.

335
00:56:47,931 --> 00:56:50,654
Two dead men
enjoying the evening.

336
00:56:51,365 --> 00:56:54,598
- What did you do?
- I disobeyed them.

337
00:56:55,529 --> 00:57:00,414
Followed him as far as I could and he...
changed.

338
00:57:00,504 --> 00:57:04,508
Oh, I see. You grew conscious.

339
00:57:04,708 --> 00:57:07,771
Our game is our game. But this...

340
00:57:08,822 --> 00:57:11,645
women, children.

341
00:57:11,665 --> 00:57:15,038
Well, the Thallium would suggest
he doesn't like you very much anymore.

342
00:57:15,099 --> 00:57:17,181
I'm clear that the
feeling in mutual.

343
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:19,363
So, why don't you tell me how
to find him again?

344
00:57:19,463 --> 00:57:24,268
- Oh, come on! Tell me where he is.
- He's everywhere!

345
00:57:25,049 --> 00:57:26,480
Everywhere!

346
00:57:26,550 --> 00:57:29,381
He's sitting at your desk,
he's kissing your

347
00:57:29,393 --> 00:57:32,066
lover or he's eating
supper with your family!

348
00:57:39,083 --> 00:57:41,445
You're protecting someone.

349
00:57:42,366 --> 00:57:43,827
Your wife?

350
00:57:46,901 --> 00:57:49,173
She left long ago.

351
00:57:49,333 --> 00:57:50,434
Your son?

352
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:56,861
Your daughter.

353
00:57:58,963 --> 00:58:01,565
You won't find her,
she's clever.

354
00:58:01,866 --> 00:58:04,819
She's smarter than me,
she knows how to hide.

355
00:58:06,811 --> 00:58:09,073
I can protect her,
if you tell me where he is.

356
00:58:11,936 --> 00:58:14,608
- I can keep her alive.
- Yeah?

357
00:58:17,812 --> 00:58:20,635
- You have my word.
- Your word?!

358
00:58:21,385 --> 00:58:23,417
The word of an assassin?

359
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,271
That's my word.

360
00:59:05,019 --> 00:59:09,223
American. You save her.

361
00:59:09,394 --> 00:59:12,497
She can lead you to the
American, she knows the American.

362
00:59:13,207 --> 00:59:18,082
Try the Chauffeur Clinic.

363
00:59:22,357 --> 00:59:26,901
You're a kite dancing in a hurricane,
Mr. Bond.

364
00:59:29,974 --> 00:59:31,075
So long!

365
01:00:24,699 --> 01:00:27,672
Can't deny I'm impressed you got
HMG to cough up for all of us.

366
01:00:27,752 --> 01:00:30,175
Good God, the government couldn't
afford this kind of facility.

367
01:00:30,195 --> 01:00:33,098
No, it was benefactor.
Mostly from the private sector.

368
01:00:33,668 --> 01:00:34,579
When it goes online,

369
01:00:34,629 --> 01:00:36,813
this building will be
the most sophisticated

370
01:00:36,825 --> 01:00:38,483
data gathering
system in history.

371
01:00:38,553 --> 01:00:41,516
The World's digital ghost available
24/7

372
01:00:41,566 --> 01:00:43,328
George Orwell's worst nightmare.

373
01:00:43,398 --> 01:00:45,070
I'm glad you like it.

374
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:47,813
My commiseration on losing the 9 Eyes vote.

375
01:00:48,023 --> 01:00:50,115
- Must have been a blow.
- Not really.

376
01:00:50,395 --> 01:00:53,457
Only matter of time before South Africa
sees the light and you know what they say,

377
01:00:53,458 --> 01:00:56,051
Rome wasn't built in a day,
a day and a half maybe.

378
01:00:57,122 --> 01:01:00,065
Look, Max.
I know surveillance is fact of life.

379
01:01:01,647 --> 01:01:05,981
It's how you use the information
that concerns me and who is using it.

380
01:01:06,021 --> 01:01:08,644
This is what we need to do
to keep the people safe.

381
01:01:09,114 --> 01:01:11,326
00 Program is prehistoric.

382
01:01:12,257 --> 01:01:16,452
Come on, M. You can't tell me that one man
in the field can compete with all of this.

383
01:01:16,472 --> 01:01:18,554
Running around out there
with his license to kill?

384
01:01:20,325 --> 01:01:22,688
Have you ever had to kill a man, Max?

385
01:01:23,869 --> 01:01:25,491
Have you?

386
01:01:25,691 --> 01:01:27,993
To pull that trigger,
you have to be sure.

387
01:01:28,013 --> 01:01:32,217
Yes, you investigate, analyze,
assess, target.

388
01:01:33,088 --> 01:01:38,644
And then you have to look them
in the eye and you make the call.

389
01:01:38,654 --> 01:01:44,410
And all the drones, bugs, cameras, transcripts,
all the surveillance in the world.

390
01:01:44,470 --> 01:01:46,942
Can't tell you what to do next.

391
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:54,019
A license to kill.
Is also a license not to kill.

392
01:01:55,721 --> 01:01:57,903
I didn't want to have to do this.

393
01:01:59,275 --> 01:02:02,378
But it looks like
you still can't control your agents.

394
01:02:03,909 --> 01:02:06,081
Bond, I ran that check.

395
01:02:06,962 --> 01:02:09,685
Looks like you've had dealings
with him before, Quantum.

396
01:02:09,695 --> 01:02:11,637
Of course, Mr. White!

397
01:02:11,807 --> 01:02:15,141
Last unconfirmed sighting, Attersee
in Austria.

398
01:02:15,201 --> 01:02:16,282
Run another name, will you?

399
01:02:18,404 --> 01:02:21,177
So, something to be said
for total surveillance after all.

400
01:02:24,430 --> 01:02:26,952
You watch MI6 agents?

401
01:02:28,024 --> 01:02:29,155
I watch everyone.

402
01:03:36,022 --> 01:03:38,905
Please take a seat.
I'll be with you in just a moment.

403
01:03:39,846 --> 01:03:45,111
Monday, an assessment of
post-traumatic diagnostic was done.

404
01:03:45,592 --> 01:03:51,908
Prescribed
medicine along with the TCC.

405
01:03:55,522 --> 01:03:58,144
Please excuse me, Mr. Bond.

406
01:04:00,316 --> 01:04:02,679
My name is Dr. Madeleine Swann.

407
01:04:02,909 --> 01:04:06,913
Our job today's to analyze your needs
both physiological and physical.

408
01:04:07,213 --> 01:04:09,326
Sounds pretty straight forward.

409
01:04:10,236 --> 01:04:12,939
I hope you don't mind,
the video can be a bit distracting.

410
01:04:13,139 --> 01:04:15,041
I haven't noticed.

411
01:04:20,887 --> 01:04:23,890
I you've filled out
most of the paperwork.

412
01:04:23,910 --> 01:04:27,804
Just a few questions to complete
your evaluation, if I may?

413
01:04:28,405 --> 01:04:31,928
- You exercise?
- When I have to.

414
01:04:32,379 --> 01:04:35,802
You consider employment to be
physiologically stressful?

415
01:04:36,283 --> 01:04:37,514
Sometimes.

416
01:04:37,924 --> 01:04:40,026
How much alcohol do you consume?

417
01:04:40,497 --> 01:04:42,069
Too much.

418
01:04:44,571 --> 01:04:48,535
SOME BROADER QUESTIONS: As a child, would
you say you were close to your parents?

419
01:04:48,615 --> 01:04:50,257
My parents died when I was young.

420
01:04:51,958 --> 01:04:53,610
Really? How old?

421
01:04:54,141 --> 01:04:57,094
- Old enough to remember.
- How, if I may ask?

422
01:04:57,484 --> 01:04:59,596
A climbing accident.

423
01:04:59,796 --> 01:05:02,489
- Then who brought you up?
- Someone else.

424
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:04,902
Humor me.

425
01:05:05,102 --> 01:05:08,115
How does one train at Oxford and
the Sorbonne

426
01:05:08,145 --> 01:05:11,758
become a consultant, spend
2 years with medicine fortifier

427
01:05:11,919 --> 01:05:14,061
and then end up here?

428
01:05:14,982 --> 01:05:19,356
Forgive me, but anyone
might think you're hiding from something.

429
01:05:21,078 --> 01:05:23,410
You're paying a lot of
money to be here, Mr. Bond.

430
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:28,045
- Who's asking the questions? You or me?
- Of course, carry on.

431
01:05:31,498 --> 01:05:34,211
I see you left this final question blank.

432
01:05:35,172 --> 01:05:36,303
What is your occupation?

433
01:05:36,423 --> 01:05:40,407
Well, that's not the sort of thing
that looks good on a form.

434
01:05:40,587 --> 01:05:43,600
- And why is that?
- I kill people.

435
01:05:46,013 --> 01:05:48,135
Small world, huh?

436
01:05:49,927 --> 01:05:54,411
- Where is he?
- Your father's dead, two days ago.

437
01:05:55,312 --> 01:05:58,205
- How do you know?
- Because I was there.

438
01:05:58,445 --> 01:06:01,058
- Did you kill him?
- I didn't have to.

439
01:06:01,258 --> 01:06:03,110
He did it himself.

440
01:06:03,891 --> 01:06:06,464
And you came all the way
just to tell me this?

441
01:06:07,565 --> 01:06:09,126
That my father's dead?

442
01:06:09,326 --> 01:06:12,369
I came to tell you that your life
is in danger and I need your help.

443
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:16,584
- Why?
- I made a deal with him to protect you.

444
01:06:17,565 --> 01:06:18,816
You're lying.

445
01:06:19,857 --> 01:06:21,108
Why would he trust you?

446
01:06:21,449 --> 01:06:24,752
Because he knew that I needed
something in return.

447
01:06:25,072 --> 01:06:28,986
- And what was that?
- To find the American.

448
01:06:29,547 --> 01:06:32,189
- This interview's over.
- Dr. Swann.

449
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:35,723
You have 10 minutes to leave the building,
then I'm calling security.

450
01:06:40,147 --> 01:06:41,769
Thank you, Dr. Swann.

451
01:07:04,372 --> 01:07:08,306
- Can I get you something, sir?
- Vodka Martini, shaken not stirred.

452
01:07:08,376 --> 01:07:11,299
I'm sorry, we don't serve alcohol.

453
01:07:11,509 --> 01:07:13,631
I'm already starting to love this place.

454
01:07:13,721 --> 01:07:16,734
Can I have the proactive
digestive enzyme shake?

455
01:07:16,804 --> 01:07:17,705
Certainly.

456
01:07:17,805 --> 01:07:20,848
If you've come for the car,
I parked it at the bottom of the toilet.

457
01:07:20,868 --> 01:07:24,201
Oh, not to worry, 007.
It was only a 3 million pound prototype.

458
01:07:24,202 --> 01:07:27,334
- Why are you here, Q?
- Oh, I just fancied a break to be honest

459
01:07:27,335 --> 01:07:29,517
I've been a tad stressed at work
recently.

460
01:07:29,727 --> 01:07:31,721
What we see is people crawling
all over us and the fact

461
01:07:31,733 --> 01:07:33,561
everyone wants my balls for
Christmas decorations.

462
01:07:33,611 --> 01:07:37,876
Get to the point - The point, 007,
is that Frank Oberhauser is dead.

463
01:07:37,986 --> 01:07:39,407
Dead and buried.

464
01:07:39,587 --> 01:07:41,417
And unless you don't
come back right now, my

465
01:07:41,429 --> 01:07:43,311
career and Moneypenny's
will go the same way.

466
01:07:43,982 --> 01:07:46,627
Do you understand? All hell is breaking
loose out there and here you a...

467
01:07:46,639 --> 01:07:47,525
I saw him.

468
01:07:47,625 --> 01:07:49,427
You thought you saw him.

469
01:07:49,627 --> 01:07:51,639
We've been through the records.

470
01:07:51,669 --> 01:07:53,970
Died in a avalanche, with
his father, 20 years...

471
01:07:53,982 --> 01:07:54,753
Yes.

472
01:07:54,763 --> 01:07:58,056
I know that but I saw him.

473
01:07:59,798 --> 01:08:02,030
It's not someone I'd ever forget.

474
01:08:03,051 --> 01:08:05,393
So, you have a lead?

475
01:08:05,453 --> 01:08:09,848
- I have a name, American.
- Well, that narrows it down.

476
01:08:09,918 --> 01:08:12,449
Look I'm sorry, 007, but time's up.

477
01:08:12,450 --> 01:08:14,462
My whole career is on the line here.

478
01:08:14,532 --> 01:08:18,256
Either you come back in and do this through
proper channels or I'll go directly to M.

479
01:08:18,286 --> 01:08:20,949
Do one more thing for me,
then you're out.

480
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:24,272
Find out what you can from this.

481
01:08:32,741 --> 01:08:36,435
- I really, really hate you right now.
- Thank you, Q.

482
01:08:37,085 --> 01:08:40,409
- Monsieur? Now, please.
- Where are you staying?

483
01:08:40,509 --> 01:08:43,422
At Desner, room 12 - One hour.

484
01:08:44,312 --> 01:08:48,196
Here you are, sir.
One proactive digestive enzyme shake.

485
01:08:48,236 --> 01:08:51,620
Do me a favour for me, will you?
Thrown that down the toilet.

486
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:53,682
Cut out the middle man.

487
01:09:02,681 --> 01:09:04,723
No, stay!

488
01:09:54,893 --> 01:09:56,525
What do you want?

489
01:09:59,758 --> 01:10:01,290
What are you doing?

490
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:04,894
Can't any of you speak?!

491
01:13:30,250 --> 01:13:32,883
Come on!

492
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:33,104
- Come out.
- Aargh, don't touch me!

493
01:14:34,645 --> 01:14:37,558
Hey, you need to take a breath
and calm down.

494
01:14:37,568 --> 01:14:40,992
- You're in shock.
- Get away from me! Just get away!

495
01:14:41,372 --> 01:14:44,235
Did it cross your mind that you
lead them to me?!

496
01:14:49,510 --> 01:14:51,082
I haven't got time for this.

497
01:14:51,172 --> 01:14:54,765
You need to tell me everything you
know about American.

498
01:14:54,886 --> 01:14:56,137
Go to hell!

499
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:01,432
I gave your father my word.

500
01:15:02,944 --> 01:15:07,198
And why should I trust you?
Because my father did?

501
01:15:07,308 --> 01:15:13,694
Because right now, Dr. Swann.
I'm your best chance of staying alive.

502
01:15:37,108 --> 01:15:41,132
Dr. Swann, Q. Q, Dr. Swann.

503
01:15:41,673 --> 01:15:43,875
- Hello.
- Enchanted.

504
01:15:45,356 --> 01:15:49,430
- Bond, we need to talk. Alone.
- She knows.

505
01:15:49,501 --> 01:15:51,913
- But Bond!
- She knows.

506
01:15:52,604 --> 01:15:56,848
- What have you got?
- I owe you an apology, 007.

507
01:15:57,048 --> 01:15:59,120
You are on to something.

508
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:02,614
Oberhauser is still alive,
the ring proves it.

509
01:16:02,964 --> 01:16:05,877
And it seems they were all
part of one organization.

510
01:16:06,227 --> 01:16:10,181
Le Chiffre, Quantum, Sciarra,
your friend, Mr. Silva.

511
01:16:10,281 --> 01:16:11,873
And do you know who links them all?

512
01:16:12,374 --> 01:16:14,996
- Him.
- Exactly.

513
01:16:15,056 --> 01:16:19,070
This organization,
do you know what's it called?

514
01:16:19,311 --> 01:16:20,782
S.P.E.C.T.R.E.

515
01:16:22,664 --> 01:16:26,147
- Its name is SPECTRE.
- How does she know that?

516
01:16:26,187 --> 01:16:28,600
Because my father was part of it.

517
01:16:29,601 --> 01:16:31,463
And I think you ought to see this.

518
01:16:31,703 --> 01:16:35,417
Looking at pictures from South Africa
right now, is what appears to be...

519
01:16:36,478 --> 01:16:39,341
Q, go back to London.

520
01:16:40,372 --> 01:16:41,763
M's gonna need your help.

521
01:16:41,833 --> 01:16:43,255
Keep tracking me.

522
01:16:43,315 --> 01:16:47,949
I will and Bond.
You have to find American.

523
01:16:48,450 --> 01:16:50,382
He's our only link to Oberhauser.

524
01:16:50,502 --> 01:16:54,476
It's not a person, it's a place.

525
01:17:59,802 --> 01:18:01,023
Thank you.

526
01:18:32,835 --> 01:18:35,598
This is where they spent the wedding night.

527
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:38,701
They came back every year.

528
01:18:39,712 --> 01:18:42,475
Then they brought me with them too.

529
01:18:45,017 --> 01:18:48,511
He kept coming back,
even after the divorce.

530
01:18:50,283 --> 01:18:52,575
Well, then. I'm sorry.

531
01:18:53,296 --> 01:18:54,707
What for?

532
01:19:10,203 --> 01:19:11,804
What is it?

533
01:19:13,446 --> 01:19:15,388
It's an inheritance.

534
01:19:15,828 --> 01:19:18,831
- Want some?
- No, thank you.

535
01:19:19,752 --> 01:19:21,394
You don't know what you're missing.

536
01:19:31,164 --> 01:19:33,576
This can't be it.

537
01:19:33,926 --> 01:19:36,379
Well, here's to your father.

538
01:19:37,620 --> 01:19:43,026
I promised myself, I would never
be hurt by that man again.

539
01:19:43,546 --> 01:19:46,229
I could have hold contact.

540
01:19:46,539 --> 01:19:50,403
I didn't want to do anything
to do with him or his sick life.

541
01:19:51,124 --> 01:19:56,039
And then with his dying
breath, he sends me you.

542
01:19:57,050 --> 01:19:58,481
Ironic, no?

543
01:19:58,611 --> 01:20:01,094
You shouldn't be so hard on him.

544
01:20:01,234 --> 01:20:04,437
And now that I've just mentioned,
he would have been dead weeks ago.

545
01:20:04,567 --> 01:20:07,460
The reason his heart was still
beating was you.

546
01:20:08,521 --> 01:20:12,095
I mourn my father in my own
time, Mr. Bond.

547
01:20:12,615 --> 01:20:15,378
And now, I'm going to bed.

548
01:20:22,225 --> 01:20:26,760
Don't think for one moment,
this is where I fall into your arms.

549
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:31,144
Seeking solace for my dead daddy.

550
01:20:34,598 --> 01:20:40,433
You sit there, keep watch.
That's what you're good at.

551
01:20:44,277 --> 01:20:47,120
Come anywhere near me
and I will kill you.

552
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:49,503
I don't doubt it.

553
01:20:59,623 --> 01:21:02,576
Look, there are 2 of you.

554
01:21:04,097 --> 01:21:09,012
Two James. Lucky me.

555
01:22:06,220 --> 01:22:09,523
Who sent you?

556
01:22:12,306 --> 01:22:14,798
Who are you working for?

557
01:22:51,565 --> 01:22:54,669
Now, where did you go?

558
01:23:22,777 --> 01:23:24,439
Of course!

559
01:24:37,803 --> 01:24:40,556
"VESPER LYND INTERROGATION"

560
01:24:47,492 --> 01:24:49,174
What is it?

561
01:24:51,566 --> 01:24:53,288
Nothing.

562
01:25:07,432 --> 01:25:08,914
What's this?

563
01:25:09,654 --> 01:25:11,086
Coordinates.

564
01:25:14,349 --> 01:25:18,794
Your father was scanning for a particular
satellite, looking for someone.

565
01:25:20,656 --> 01:25:22,968
He was looking for him.

566
01:25:24,289 --> 01:25:27,392
And he sent me here to finish the job.

567
01:25:28,944 --> 01:25:31,256
- I'm coming with you.
- No, you're not.

568
01:25:31,807 --> 01:25:34,940
- I'd like you alive.
- I can look after myself.

569
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:36,842
That's beside the point.

570
01:25:38,143 --> 01:25:41,086
- I might not be coming back.
- I know.

571
01:25:42,347 --> 01:25:45,370
But I want to understand what
happened to my father.

572
01:26:03,849 --> 01:26:06,101
So, where was he going?

573
01:26:09,154 --> 01:26:11,166
Nowhere.

574
01:26:26,562 --> 01:26:27,233
What's going on?

575
01:26:27,353 --> 01:26:29,064
Well a meeting was brought forward,
did you not get the message?

576
01:26:29,185 --> 01:26:30,366
No, we didn't.

577
01:26:30,446 --> 01:26:33,719
- Shortest meeting I can remember.
- South Africa's on board I take it?

578
01:26:33,759 --> 01:26:35,421
Yeah, well. Who can blame them?

579
01:26:35,461 --> 01:26:37,593
9 Eyes is now officially sanctioned.

580
01:26:37,653 --> 01:26:40,516
The new system goes live in
less than 72 hours.

581
01:26:40,556 --> 01:26:42,138
It's a major step forward.

582
01:26:42,578 --> 01:26:44,320
Global Intelligence Corporation
changes everythi...

583
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:46,022
As, you've said before.

584
01:26:47,953 --> 01:26:54,210
Look, they've asked me to head
the new committee - Yes. And?

585
01:26:54,230 --> 01:26:57,423
And I should tell you I've spoken
with the Home Secretary.

586
01:26:57,743 --> 01:27:00,536
And in light of the new
information I have given him.

587
01:27:00,586 --> 01:27:03,789
He's decided to close down the 00 Program
with immediate effect.

588
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:09,095
- You don't know what you're doing.
- It's not personal. It's the future.

589
01:27:09,435 --> 01:27:10,546
And...

590
01:27:13,499 --> 01:27:16,612
You're not - You're a cocky
little bastard, aren't you?

591
01:27:18,514 --> 01:27:21,717
- I'll take that as a compliment.
- I wouldn't.

592
01:27:22,688 --> 01:27:24,821
This isn't over yet.

593
01:27:42,338 --> 01:27:44,370
- Will you press this for me?
- Thank you.

594
01:28:04,801 --> 01:28:06,272
Pick it up.

595
01:28:07,413 --> 01:28:08,675
I hate guns.

596
01:28:09,205 --> 01:28:11,628
I promised him I'd protect you.

597
01:28:11,828 --> 01:28:14,751
The first thing to do is to teach
you how to protect yourself.

598
01:28:14,811 --> 01:28:19,025
- What if I shoot you be mistake?
- Wouldn't be the first time.

599
01:28:19,776 --> 01:28:22,909
- Pick it up.
- I said I hate guns.

600
01:28:28,715 --> 01:28:32,449
SIG-226, front side
rear side, hammer.

601
01:28:38,905 --> 01:28:42,969
You just point it, squeeze the trigger
and try not to close your eyes.

602
01:28:44,150 --> 01:28:47,604
Please, try it.

603
01:29:12,069 --> 01:29:14,861
I don't have to teach you anything, do I?

604
01:29:16,713 --> 01:29:20,027
A man once came to our
house to kill my father.

605
01:29:20,527 --> 01:29:23,770
He didn't know I was upstairs
playing in my bedroom.

606
01:29:23,971 --> 01:29:28,165
Papa kept a Beretta 9mm under
the sink with the bleach.

607
01:29:31,608 --> 01:29:33,881
That's why I hate guns.

608
01:29:34,882 --> 01:29:37,925
I think we'll skip
hand-to-hand combat.

609
01:29:55,462 --> 01:29:57,684
Evening, sir.
Sorry to interrupt your supper.

610
01:29:57,694 --> 01:29:59,767
- But we have some news.
- Evening, sir.

611
01:30:00,467 --> 01:30:05,642
Using the Smart Blood, I've tracked
Bond to a point here. In North Africa.

612
01:30:06,754 --> 01:30:10,407
The everyday map, registers it as an
empty desert - Exactly, but if you look

613
01:30:10,507 --> 01:30:13,530
with a satellite blow up,
we can clearly see this.

614
01:30:13,661 --> 01:30:15,342
We can't help him.

615
01:30:16,363 --> 01:30:18,596
But, sir.
We know where he's heading.

616
01:30:19,637 --> 01:30:24,021
C is watching everything we do.
We're only handing them more information.

617
01:30:27,474 --> 01:30:32,099
- Sir, we can't just desert Bond.
- We have to, we only make him weaker.

618
01:30:32,149 --> 01:30:34,502
- Sir, you know exactly where he is.
- Yes, I know,

619
01:30:34,512 --> 01:30:36,794
If we can track him, so
can others.

620
01:30:37,004 --> 01:30:41,148
Delete all the Smart Blood files,
everything.

621
01:30:42,850 --> 01:30:44,562
He's on his own.

622
01:31:10,648 --> 01:31:14,302
- You shouldn't stare.
- Well, you shouldn't look like that.

623
01:31:18,256 --> 01:31:21,219
- May I get you a cup of tea?
- I'm not sure.

624
01:31:21,419 --> 01:31:24,502
Gets me into trouble,
makes me do crazy things.

625
01:31:24,742 --> 01:31:30,288
- Well, we can't have that.
- So, I'll have Vodka Martini, dirty.

626
01:31:30,348 --> 01:31:31,989
Make that two.

627
01:31:35,303 --> 01:31:38,386
- I have a question.
- What's that?

628
01:31:38,476 --> 01:31:41,679
Why given any other possible option,

629
01:31:41,799 --> 01:31:44,242
does a man choose a life
of a paid assassin?

630
01:31:44,352 --> 01:31:46,724
Well, it was either that or a priesthood.

631
01:31:48,306 --> 01:31:49,907
I'm serious.

632
01:31:50,228 --> 01:31:53,241
Is this really what you want?
Living in the shadows?

633
01:31:53,321 --> 01:31:55,964
Hunting, being hunted.

634
01:31:56,154 --> 01:31:59,367
Always looking behind
you, always alone?

635
01:31:59,597 --> 01:32:01,509
No, I'm not alone.

636
01:32:01,539 --> 01:32:03,251
Answer the question.

637
01:32:04,442 --> 01:32:06,995
I'm not sure I ever had a choice.

638
01:32:08,356 --> 01:32:10,488
Anyway,
I don't stop to think about it.

639
01:32:10,578 --> 01:32:12,750
What would happen if you did?

640
01:32:13,431 --> 01:32:16,244
- Stop?
- Yes

641
01:32:19,978 --> 01:32:21,699
I don't know.

642
01:32:21,790 --> 01:32:25,543
- Your drinks, sir.
- Could you leave them there please?

643
01:32:37,325 --> 01:32:39,457
You know, I think you're wrong.

644
01:32:39,888 --> 01:32:41,369
I am?

645
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:44,783
We always have a choice.

646
01:32:47,095 --> 01:32:48,777
I'll drink to that.

647
01:35:37,016 --> 01:35:38,478
Shit!

648
01:35:46,105 --> 01:35:47,647
What do we do now?

649
01:36:47,507 --> 01:36:49,819
This might be a long way.

650
01:36:51,741 --> 01:36:53,833
Are you having a second thought?

651
01:36:54,704 --> 01:36:56,406
Too late now.

652
01:37:15,555 --> 01:37:17,147
What's that?

653
01:37:32,372 --> 01:37:37,818
That is a 1948
Rolls Royce Silver Wraith.

654
01:38:01,462 --> 01:38:03,303
Please.

655
01:38:25,356 --> 01:38:27,177
I'm scared, James.

656
01:39:10,671 --> 01:39:14,005
Good afternoon, Mr. Bond. Dr. Swann

657
01:39:14,085 --> 01:39:17,798
I want you to know just how
excited we all are to finally meet you.

658
01:39:17,838 --> 01:39:20,821
Well, it's a pleasure to be here.

659
01:39:20,902 --> 01:39:26,027
Your host invites you both to rest, relax
and meet him for drinks at 4:00.

660
01:39:26,337 --> 01:39:28,539
- Tell our host, we won't be late.
- Wonderful!

661
01:39:28,860 --> 01:39:32,393
Before we show you to
your rooms, just one more thing.

662
01:39:43,204 --> 01:39:45,506
You be careful with that.

663
01:39:45,787 --> 01:39:47,418
It's loaded.

664
01:39:53,675 --> 01:39:55,196
Thank you.

665
01:40:54,185 --> 01:40:56,888
This is a very special place.

666
01:40:56,918 --> 01:40:59,911
He has requested,
you enter it alone.

667
01:41:00,682 --> 01:41:01,963
Of course.

668
01:41:04,636 --> 01:41:05,927
Champagne?

669
01:41:07,149 --> 01:41:09,261
Maybe later.

670
01:41:09,411 --> 01:41:11,153
Certainly.

671
01:41:42,074 --> 01:41:44,516
I think we're meant to be impressed.

672
01:41:57,599 --> 01:41:59,241
Touch it.

673
01:42:00,742 --> 01:42:02,905
You can touch it if you want.

674
01:42:05,057 --> 01:42:08,560
- Do you know what it is?
- It's a meteorite.

675
01:42:09,571 --> 01:42:11,754
Yes, exactly!

676
01:42:12,254 --> 01:42:16,078
Kartenhoff,
the oldest in human possession.

677
01:42:16,759 --> 01:42:20,312
The very meteorite which made this crater.

678
01:42:21,543 --> 01:42:22,625
Think about it.

679
01:42:23,475 --> 01:42:27,740
So many years up
there alone, silent.

680
01:42:28,130 --> 01:42:32,725
Building momentum until it
chose to make its mark on Earth.

681
01:42:34,016 --> 01:42:37,089
Huge unstoppable force.

682
01:42:37,099 --> 01:42:39,261
Except it did stop, didn't it?

683
01:42:39,962 --> 01:42:41,343
Right here.

684
01:42:55,918 --> 01:42:59,632
I can't tell you how much I have been
looking forward to this.

685
01:42:59,822 --> 01:43:02,585
All of us here, together.

686
01:43:04,837 --> 01:43:07,079
A reunion.

687
01:43:08,791 --> 01:43:12,024
So glad you came too,
dear Madeleine.

688
01:43:13,215 --> 01:43:16,579
You were just a girl,
when I saw you first.

689
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:20,993
I came to your home once
to see your father.

690
01:43:23,025 --> 01:43:25,248
I don't remember that.

691
01:43:25,988 --> 01:43:27,790
But I do.

692
01:43:31,974 --> 01:43:33,826
Shall we?

693
01:43:37,160 --> 01:43:39,051
What is this place?

694
01:43:39,102 --> 01:43:40,893
Information.

695
01:43:43,796 --> 01:43:46,199
Information is all.

696
01:43:47,039 --> 01:43:48,661
Is it not?

697
01:43:49,482 --> 01:43:50,802
For example..

698
01:43:50,803 --> 01:43:50,813
You must know by now, that the 00 Program
is officially dead. For example..

699
01:43:50,814 --> 01:43:55,398
You must know by now,
that the 00 Program is officially dead.

700
01:43:56,249 --> 01:44:00,573
Which leaves me to speculate,
exactly why you came?

701
01:44:03,186 --> 01:44:06,559
So, James. Why did you come?

702
01:44:06,749 --> 01:44:08,631
I came here to kill you.

703
01:44:09,332 --> 01:44:11,945
And I thought you came here to die.

704
01:44:12,065 --> 01:44:17,891
- It's all the matter of perspective.
- Speaking of perspective,

705
01:44:35,248 --> 01:44:39,462
- Is this live?
- Live and direct, 16:20 GMT.

706
01:44:39,783 --> 01:44:42,045
What an uncanny coincidence.

707
01:44:42,265 --> 01:44:43,977
The French have a saying:

708
01:44:44,017 --> 01:44:46,830
"It's the fate of glass to break."

709
01:44:46,890 --> 01:44:51,034
Well, maybe it's the fate of
spies to just disappear.

710
01:44:51,064 --> 01:44:55,328
But with any luck,
we leave something behind.

711
01:44:55,558 --> 01:44:59,442
In the meantime,
I'm sure C will keep you all busy.

712
01:44:59,743 --> 01:45:02,035
Thank you all.

713
01:45:04,688 --> 01:45:09,092
It's touching, don't you think?

714
01:45:10,924 --> 01:45:12,996
Poor old James.

715
01:45:13,537 --> 01:45:15,459
It looks like you're all alone.

716
01:45:15,839 --> 01:45:18,672
Not much more than
a voyeur, are you?

717
01:45:19,543 --> 01:45:21,974
Too scared to join in?

718
01:45:21,975 --> 01:45:21,985
- I don't think you quite understand.
- I think I do. Too scared to join in?

719
01:45:21,986 --> 01:45:25,048
- I don't think you quite understand.
- I think I do.

720
01:45:25,138 --> 01:45:29,052
You set cities on fire, watch innocent
people burn so you can convince

721
01:45:29,062 --> 01:45:32,666
governments to join the
intelligence network you paid for.

722
01:45:32,976 --> 01:45:34,217
Not that complicated

723
01:45:35,499 --> 01:45:40,023
I'm guessing out little friend, C,
is one of your disciples?

724
01:45:40,724 --> 01:45:42,556
You could say that.

725
01:45:42,686 --> 01:45:44,598
What does he get out of it?

726
01:45:45,108 --> 01:45:46,250
Nothing?

727
01:45:47,070 --> 01:45:51,054
- He's a visionary, like me.
- Visionaries, I see.

728
01:45:51,445 --> 01:45:53,337
Psychiatry wards are full of them.

729
01:45:53,417 --> 01:45:56,350
Where as you can see
what's right in front of you.

730
01:45:56,380 --> 01:46:00,013
You came across me so many
times and yet you never saw me.

731
01:46:00,884 --> 01:46:04,268
- Le Chiffre, Greene, Silva...
- All dead.

732
01:46:04,818 --> 01:46:05,929
That's right.

733
01:46:06,170 --> 01:46:08,532
A nice pattern developed,
you interfered

734
01:46:08,552 --> 01:46:10,704
in my world, I destroyed yours.

735
01:46:12,906 --> 01:46:17,831
Or did you think it was coincidence that
all the women in your life ended up dead?

736
01:46:18,342 --> 01:46:21,345
Vesper Lynd, for example.

737
01:46:22,186 --> 01:46:25,469
She was the big one,
has he told you about her?

738
01:46:27,871 --> 01:46:31,835
An then of course,
your beloved M.

739
01:46:31,996 --> 01:46:34,898
Gone forever.

740
01:46:37,721 --> 01:46:39,823
Me...

741
01:46:41,095 --> 01:46:43,347
It was all me, James.

742
01:46:43,427 --> 01:46:48,222
It's always been me.
The author of all your pain.

743
01:46:50,815 --> 01:46:53,687
You're a brave woman, my dear.

744
01:47:00,354 --> 01:47:04,148
Now I understand why my
father lost his mind.

745
01:47:04,188 --> 01:47:06,991
He didn't lose his mind,
he was just weak.

746
01:47:07,121 --> 01:47:10,224
But at least he understood,
what he was up against.

747
01:47:10,434 --> 01:47:12,757
You see, they fail to
comprehend a crucial fact that.

748
01:47:13,057 --> 01:47:16,440
A terrible event,
can lead to something wonderful.

749
01:47:18,923 --> 01:47:21,866
Since you mentioned
you father, I'll show you.

750
01:47:22,006 --> 01:47:26,641
She's clever, she's smarter than me.
She knows how to hide.

751
01:47:26,671 --> 01:47:30,945
And I'm going to protect her
if you tell me where he is.

752
01:47:33,457 --> 01:47:36,339
- I can keep her alive.
- Yeah.

753
01:47:36,340 --> 01:47:36,350
You have my word - I can keep her alive.
Yeah.

754
01:47:36,351 --> 01:47:37,682
You have my word.

755
01:47:37,712 --> 01:47:40,044
No, no, no, no, no.
Turn this off.

756
01:47:40,204 --> 01:47:41,796
Word?

757
01:47:41,906 --> 01:47:43,347
The word of an assassin?

758
01:47:43,367 --> 01:47:44,398
Turn this off!

759
01:47:44,749 --> 01:47:47,752
- This is important.
- I said turn it off!

760
01:47:49,514 --> 01:47:52,457
I want you to understand something.

761
01:48:01,486 --> 01:48:04,379
That's my word

762
01:48:04,459 --> 01:48:05,660
Madeleine.

763
01:48:06,250 --> 01:48:08,142
Look at me.

764
01:48:08,973 --> 01:48:13,027
Look at him, Madeleine.
Look at me.

765
01:48:14,279 --> 01:48:15,820
American.

766
01:48:16,911 --> 01:48:22,056
You save her, she can lead you to
the American. She knows the American.

767
01:48:25,150 --> 01:48:27,422
Try the Chauffeur Clinic.

768
01:48:33,418 --> 01:48:38,543
You're a kite dancing in a
hurricane, Mr. Bond.

769
01:48:40,985 --> 01:48:42,987
So long.

770
01:48:48,813 --> 01:48:53,168
Things that bring people together.

771
01:48:56,581 --> 01:48:59,925
Out of horror, beauty.

772
01:49:24,669 --> 01:49:28,854
Torture is an easy and efficient way.

773
01:49:28,904 --> 01:49:32,357
A man can watch himself
being disemboweled.

774
01:49:32,507 --> 01:49:36,191
Surprise brings horror to the experience.

775
01:49:36,321 --> 01:49:39,364
It can go over a distance,
it isn't taking

776
01:49:39,424 --> 01:49:40,926
place where he is.

777
01:49:42,107 --> 01:49:44,799
You know all too well, my dear Madeleine.

778
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:47,412
A man lives inside his head.

779
01:49:48,083 --> 01:49:51,486
That's where the seed of the soul is.

780
01:49:52,588 --> 01:49:57,933
James and I were both present recently.
When a man was deprived of his eyes.

781
01:49:58,303 --> 01:50:03,208
And the most astonishing thing happened,
didn't you notice?

782
01:50:03,468 --> 01:50:05,521
He wasn't there anymore.

783
01:50:05,941 --> 01:50:08,634
He's gone even though, he's still alive.

784
01:50:08,674 --> 01:50:11,637
This brief moment between life and death.

785
01:50:12,257 --> 01:50:15,330
There was nobody inside his skull.

786
01:50:16,001 --> 01:50:18,343
Most odd.

787
01:50:20,005 --> 01:50:21,997
So, James.

788
01:50:23,148 --> 01:50:29,745
I'm going to penetrate to where you are.

789
01:50:29,941 --> 01:50:32,718
To the inside of you head.

790
01:50:33,158 --> 01:50:36,842
The first probe will
play with your sight.

791
01:50:36,948 --> 01:50:40,259
Your hearing and your balance.

792
01:50:40,406 --> 01:50:45,621
- Just with a subtlest of manipulations.
- Well, get on with it then.

793
01:50:46,077 --> 01:50:49,521
Nothing can be as painful
as listening to you talk.

794
01:50:50,189 --> 01:50:51,907
Alright.

795
01:50:52,378 --> 01:50:54,390
Let's begin!

796
01:51:26,452 --> 01:51:28,684
Why are we doing this?

797
01:51:41,560 --> 01:51:46,682
You probably know that, James here
lost his parents when he was young.

798
01:51:48,981 --> 01:51:54,751
But did you know that it was my father who
helped him through this difficult time?

799
01:52:02,408 --> 01:52:09,375
Over the course of 2 winters,
he taught him to ski, climb and hunt.

800
01:52:09,521 --> 01:52:14,831
He soothed the wounds of the
poor little blue eyed orphan.

801
01:52:16,583 --> 01:52:19,318
Asked me to treat him as a brother.

802
01:52:19,719 --> 01:52:21,267
My little brother.

803
01:52:22,775 --> 01:52:25,982
They formed quite an attachment.

804
01:52:26,753 --> 01:52:30,847
No, you killed him.

805
01:52:31,263 --> 01:52:33,349
Yes, I did.

806
01:52:36,415 --> 01:52:42,141
You know what happens when a Cuckoo
hatches inside another bird's nest?

807
01:52:45,532 --> 01:52:49,201
- It's forced to steal the eggs out.
- Yes.

808
01:52:49,308 --> 01:52:55,281
Well, this Cuckoo made me
realize my father's life had to end.

809
01:52:55,715 --> 01:52:58,585
In a way, he's responsible
for the path I took.

810
01:52:58,651 --> 01:53:01,578
So, thank you. Cuckoo!

811
01:53:06,766 --> 01:53:10,016
Do you know any bird calls, Franz?

812
01:53:17,404 --> 01:53:19,376
Hello, pussy.

813
01:53:21,581 --> 01:53:25,105
Franz Oberhauser
died 20 years ago, James.

814
01:53:25,238 --> 01:53:28,525
In an avalanche,
alongside his father.

815
01:53:29,242 --> 01:53:34,371
The man you're talking to now,
the man inside your head.

816
01:53:34,381 --> 01:53:37,234
Is Ernst Stavro Blofeld.

817
01:53:37,464 --> 01:53:41,688
- Fancy name?
- My mother's bloodline.

818
01:53:42,839 --> 01:53:47,674
If the needle finds the correct spot
in the circumvoluþia spindle.

819
01:53:47,700 --> 01:53:49,649
You'll recognize no one.

820
01:53:49,916 --> 01:53:54,111
Of course, the faces of your women might
have changed a lot a lot, huh, James.

821
01:53:55,415 --> 01:53:57,150
You won't know who she is.

822
01:53:57,190 --> 01:54:01,418
Just another passing face
on your way to the grave.

823
01:54:09,149 --> 01:54:12,599
He dies not knowing who you are.

824
01:54:14,087 --> 01:54:19,236
The daughter of an assassin,
the only one who could have understand.

825
01:54:19,987 --> 01:54:21,281
Shame.

826
01:54:58,185 --> 01:55:00,007
I love you.

827
01:55:05,085 --> 01:55:08,285
Do those blue eyes still recognize you?

828
01:55:11,429 --> 01:55:15,032
I'd recognize you anywhere.

829
01:55:17,144 --> 01:55:18,776
Watch.

830
01:55:33,567 --> 01:55:34,955
One minute.

831
01:55:36,584 --> 01:55:38,886
One minute.

832
01:55:42,109 --> 01:55:44,061
Did he say something?

833
01:55:44,071 --> 01:55:45,993
I guess you did.

834
01:55:47,007 --> 01:55:50,304
- What?
- Tempes... fugit...

835
01:55:50,478 --> 01:55:52,690
I can't hear you, James.

836
01:55:54,522 --> 01:55:59,347
I said, "doesn't time fly"?

837
01:56:26,100 --> 01:56:27,435
There!

838
01:57:08,730 --> 01:57:10,344
Let's go home.

839
01:57:26,440 --> 01:57:28,236
It's not over yet.

840
01:58:17,966 --> 01:58:22,351
- Nobody's ever heard of Hildebram.
- That is the general idea of safe houses.

841
01:58:39,928 --> 01:58:42,771
- Exactly how safe is this, sir?
- We're about to find out.

842
01:58:46,868 --> 01:58:49,949
It's safe. A bit of wait.

843
01:58:53,448 --> 01:58:55,664
- I'm M.
- Madeleine Swann.

844
01:58:55,714 --> 01:58:58,760
Pleased to meet you.
So, what do you have for me, 007?

845
01:58:59,438 --> 01:59:03,222
The recently deceased head of SPECTRE,
Ernst Stavro Blofeld

846
01:59:03,578 --> 01:59:08,117
and his chief of intelligence,
your new best friend, C.

847
01:59:08,583 --> 01:59:12,772
Were about to take control of his very own
global surveillance system that he built.

848
01:59:12,782 --> 01:59:15,404
- Right here, under our noses.
- Then we'd better move.

849
01:59:15,444 --> 01:59:17,099
The system goes online at midnight.

850
01:59:17,126 --> 01:59:20,275
If that happens SPECTRE
will have control of everything.

851
01:59:20,315 --> 01:59:22,629
So, you and I will have a
quiet word with C. While Q

852
01:59:22,641 --> 01:59:24,880
hacks into the system and
stops it getting online.

853
01:59:25,360 --> 01:59:27,683
- It won't be easy.
- He'll find a way.

854
01:59:27,737 --> 01:59:29,739
He always does.

855
01:59:33,943 --> 01:59:38,147
- It's good to have you back 007
- Sir.

856
01:59:47,222 --> 01:59:51,681
- James, I can't.
- I'll come back for you.

857
01:59:51,881 --> 01:59:55,515
- When it's all over.
- I know I can't.

858
01:59:55,765 --> 02:00:00,329
- You can't stay here or...?
- I can't go back to this life.

859
02:00:00,450 --> 02:00:03,172
And I'm not doing to ask you to change.

860
02:00:03,372 --> 02:00:05,254
This is who you are.

861
02:00:07,523 --> 02:00:11,030
- You're saying goodbye.
- Yes.

862
02:00:13,409 --> 02:00:15,204
Take care.

863
02:00:17,039 --> 02:00:19,218
You're a good man, James.

864
02:01:20,340 --> 02:01:22,065
Are you in yet, Q?

865
02:01:22,172 --> 02:01:24,845
Few layers of impenetrable
layers to go but I think

866
02:01:24,868 --> 02:01:26,086
I'm getting somewhere.

867
02:02:15,078 --> 02:02:17,568
- They've seen us.
- Move back!

868
02:02:56,360 --> 02:02:58,168
Go!

869
02:03:08,612 --> 02:03:10,451
Get into the building!

870
02:03:10,681 --> 02:03:13,484
Move. Move!

871
02:04:31,936 --> 02:04:35,019
Go back and find M, now!
We need them both.

872
02:04:45,069 --> 02:04:47,849
Not a good feeling
being watched, is it?

873
02:04:52,409 --> 02:04:54,439
Don't tell me you're
responsible for this.

874
02:04:54,492 --> 02:04:56,561
No, but my quartermaster is.

875
02:04:57,281 --> 02:04:59,481
And he's extremely talented.

876
02:04:59,577 --> 02:05:04,356
Bravo, but in case you haven't
realized it. You two are out of a job.

877
02:05:04,902 --> 02:05:08,760
So you're trespassing - I'm afraid you've
got the wrong end of the stick, Max.

878
02:05:08,800 --> 02:05:11,673
We're going to stop this
system going online.

879
02:05:11,723 --> 02:05:14,859
- Then I'm going to bring you in.
- On what grounds exactly?

880
02:05:14,939 --> 02:05:17,269
Poor taste in friends.

881
02:05:53,045 --> 02:05:55,097
Take a look at the world.

882
02:05:57,009 --> 02:05:58,610
Chaos!

883
02:05:59,317 --> 02:06:01,066
Because people like you.

884
02:06:01,319 --> 02:06:06,071
Paper-pushers, politician are too spineless
to deal which what needs to be done.

885
02:06:06,588 --> 02:06:10,502
So, I made an alliance to put
the power where it should be.

886
02:06:10,555 --> 02:06:15,487
And now you want to throw it
away for the sake of democracy.

887
02:06:16,241 --> 02:06:18,003
Whatever the hell that is.

888
02:06:18,243 --> 02:06:20,712
How predictably moronic.

889
02:06:20,953 --> 02:06:24,246
But then isn't that
what M stands for?

890
02:06:26,264 --> 02:06:28,120
Moron?

891
02:06:29,561 --> 02:06:32,855
Now you know what C stands for.

892
02:06:36,128 --> 02:06:37,830
Careless.

893
02:07:16,982 --> 02:07:18,521
Come on!

894
02:07:19,197 --> 02:07:21,263
No, no, no!

895
02:08:24,663 --> 02:08:27,620
You're a hard man to kill, Blofeld.

896
02:08:36,822 --> 02:08:39,772
I do hope that
doesn't hurt too much.

897
02:08:39,999 --> 02:08:42,255
Oh, my wounds will heal.

898
02:08:43,576 --> 02:08:45,668
What about yours?

899
02:08:47,190 --> 02:08:52,145
Look around, James. Look!
This is what's left of your world.

900
02:08:52,185 --> 02:08:56,970
Everything you ever stood for,
everything you believed in. A ruin.

901
02:08:57,510 --> 02:08:59,622
Why am I here?

902
02:09:00,860 --> 02:09:05,258
- Did you miss me?
- No.

903
02:09:11,658 --> 02:09:14,197
But I know someone who does!

904
02:09:22,375 --> 02:09:27,210
- Where is she?
- That's for you to find out.

905
02:09:35,134 --> 02:09:38,722
Three minutes, this
building will be demolished.

906
02:09:38,752 --> 02:09:41,087
Well, I can get out easily.

907
02:09:41,154 --> 02:09:43,386
But you have a choice.

908
02:09:43,587 --> 02:09:46,269
Die trying to save her, or.

909
02:09:46,470 --> 02:09:49,272
Save yourself and
live with the pain.

910
02:09:49,669 --> 02:09:51,775
You're bluffing.

911
02:09:53,407 --> 02:09:54,798
Am I?

912
02:10:01,921 --> 02:10:04,978
I've really got you
now haven't I?

913
02:10:05,792 --> 02:10:08,241
Oh, that's rather sweet.

914
02:10:08,442 --> 02:10:11,204
They always know which button to press.

915
02:10:24,398 --> 02:10:25,889
Madeleine!

916
02:10:31,471 --> 02:10:34,648
Come on, come on.

917
02:10:36,062 --> 02:10:37,541
Yes!

918
02:10:39,213 --> 02:10:42,946
Let's go. After you.

919
02:10:52,666 --> 02:10:55,129
Why can't you just face it, M?

920
02:10:57,164 --> 02:11:01,205
- You don't matter anymore.
- Maybe I don't.

921
02:11:01,475 --> 02:11:02,649
But something has to.

922
02:11:57,825 --> 02:11:59,934
- Dead.
- Any word on Bond?

923
02:11:59,974 --> 02:12:02,162
No, but I can hazard a guess.

924
02:12:10,197 --> 02:12:11,756
Madeleine!

925
02:12:14,334 --> 02:12:15,980
Madeleine!

926
02:13:01,209 --> 02:13:03,638
- Do you trust me?
- Do I have a choice?

927
02:13:03,664 --> 02:13:05,450
Not anymore.

928
02:13:15,703 --> 02:13:17,382
Come on!

929
02:13:31,933 --> 02:13:33,939
Goodbye, James Bond.

930
02:16:45,942 --> 02:16:49,395
- Sir, there's a terrorist alert.
- Mallory, 00 Section.

931
02:16:51,774 --> 02:16:53,750
Stand them down.

932
02:16:54,951 --> 02:16:58,515
The Go Team hold. Stand down.

933
02:17:34,421 --> 02:17:35,912
Finish it.

934
02:17:47,344 --> 02:17:49,166
Finish it!

935
02:18:01,528 --> 02:18:02,749
Out of bullets.

936
02:18:19,546 --> 02:18:23,810
And besides,
I've got something better to do.

937
02:19:10,581 --> 02:19:13,183
Under the special
measures act of 2001

938
02:19:13,196 --> 02:19:15,993
I'm detaining you on behalf of
Her Majesty's government.

939
02:20:22,080 --> 02:20:23,294
Bond?

940
02:20:28,076 --> 02:20:30,518
- What are you doing here?
- Good morning, Q.

941
02:20:38,306 --> 02:20:40,478
- I thought you'd gone.
- I have.

942
02:20:42,440 --> 02:20:45,303
There's just one thing I need.

943
02:20:45,327 --> 02:21:01,327
<font color="#ffff80"><b>Hope it helped -> bozxphd</b></font>
