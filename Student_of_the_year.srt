00:04:06,073 --> 00:04:07,062
<i>The one you signed, sir.</i>

14
00:04:07,273 --> 00:04:08,945
I aIready toId you, I'm broke!

15
00:04:09,153 --> 00:04:10,632
<i>No savings, nothing!</i>

00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:15,031
Yes, sir, but we're tired
of hearing the same oId excuses.

17
00:04:15,233 --> 00:04:17,747
We've been forced to put you on

Worse! I'm a sIave.

22
00:04:30,073 --> 00:04:30,983
You know what?

23
00:04:31,193 --> 00:04:33,627
<i>Stick the debt up your arse!</i>

24
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:34,982
<i>Did you hear me?</i>

25
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:39,263
Sir, we're concerned about

You sound tense, sir.
Are your veins throbbing?

00:04:58,513 --> 00:04:59,423
<i>What did you say?</i>

33
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:03,421
<i>Are you getting nervous?</i>
<i>Hear strange voices in your head?</i>

34
00:05:03,673 --> 00:05:07,825
Like your niece's?
Artichoke! How are you, sweetheart?

35
00:05:08,753 --> 00:05:09,788
Bastard!

36

00:05:12,393 --> 00:05:14,429
AIma! AIma!

38
00:05:14,633 --> 00:05:15,668
You bastard!

39
00:05:15,873 --> 00:05:17,591
<i>You got me there!</i>

40
00:05:17,793 --> 00:05:19,590
Dance, Arti, dance!

41
00:05:20,393 --> 00:05:22,270
<i>You and that other wanker laughing.</i>

42
00:05:24,193 --> 00:05:25,512
She tricked me!

43
00:05:27,913 --> 00:05:29,028
AIma.

44
00:05:30,713 --> 00:05:32,704
We can't find him an<i>yw</i>here.

45
00:05:32,913 --> 00:05:35,381
We've caIIed everyone
and Iooked ever<i>yw</i>here.

46
00:05:35,593 --> 00:05:36,787
Nobody's seen him.

47
00:06:00,313 --> 00:06:00,393
THE OLIVE TREE

48
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:05,183
THE OLIVE TREE

49
00:07:30,513 --> 00:07:31,866
You hear that?

50
00:07:32,913 --> 00:07:34,107
Grandad.

51
00:07:36,913 --> 00:07:38,505
Grandad, Iisten.

52
00:07:46,353 --> 00:07:48,628
<i>ls that a nightingale singing?</i>

53
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:51,905
<i>No, it's a greenfinch.</i>

54
00:07:54,793 --> 00:07:57,432
They say the Romans
might have pIanted these.

55
00:07:57,953 --> 00:07:59,068
Who knows.

56
00:07:59,273 --> 00:08:01,833
This tree is at Ieast
two thousand years oId.

57
00:08:03,073 --> 00:08:05,985
You know how Iong that is?
I don't.

58
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:08,266
I know it's a Iong time.

59
00:08:08,473 --> 00:08:10,623
It's been here my whoIe Iife
and hasn't changed.

60
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:15,912
This is where the new tree sprouts from.

61
00:08:16,633 --> 00:08:18,032
I'II show you, then you do it.

62
00:08:27,433 --> 00:08:28,912
String...

63
00:08:29,473 --> 00:08:31,828
And who taught you
how to graft?

64
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:33,512
Tighter, tighter.

65
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:37,863
My grandad taught my dad
and my dad taught me

66
00:08:38,073 --> 00:08:41,145
and I'm teaching you.
That's how Iife works.

67
00:08:41,353 --> 00:08:43,344
You pass it down.

68
00:08:44,433 --> 00:08:45,627
A new tree!

69
00:08:45,873 --> 00:08:48,262
Let's hope it grows
Iike this one.

70
00:08:51,273 --> 00:08:53,946
Look, Grandad! A monster.

71
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:55,468
You see it?

72
00:08:56,153 --> 00:08:57,586
Where?

73
00:08:57,793 --> 00:09:01,422
Here's an eye,
the other eye, the nose,

74
00:09:01,633 --> 00:09:03,589
and the mouth is super wide open.

75
00:09:04,033 --> 00:09:05,307
But it has no teeth.

76
00:09:05,513 --> 00:09:06,662
You see it?

77
00:09:07,193 --> 00:09:09,832
We'II keep the monster company.

78
00:09:10,033 --> 00:09:12,149
And we'II bring him grub to eat.

79
00:09:25,313 --> 00:09:27,144
It's not here, Grandad.

80
00:09:32,433 --> 00:09:34,071
It's not here.

81
00:09:34,753 --> 00:09:36,391
Come on, Iet's go.

82
00:09:37,113 --> 00:09:38,182
Come on.

83
00:09:48,193 --> 00:09:50,024
He's got us right where he wants us.

84
00:09:51,033 --> 00:09:52,625
Running after him,
as usuaI,

85
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:53,788
at his service.

86
00:09:55,993 --> 00:09:58,712
Worried sick, chasing him around...
Give me a break.

87
00:09:58,913 --> 00:10:00,551
He just wants attention.

88
00:10:03,993 --> 00:10:06,223
Just Iike you with that hair.

89
00:10:06,433 --> 00:10:07,991
-Luis...
-Leave her aIone.

90
00:10:08,193 --> 00:10:12,186
He has us aII on edge.
Like he wants us to suffer.

91
00:10:13,793 --> 00:10:15,431
What? You disagree?

92
00:10:18,153 --> 00:10:19,268
Something to say?

93
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:23,028
Great.

94
00:10:24,193 --> 00:10:25,592
SiIence.

95
00:10:27,633 --> 00:10:29,783
I know that punishment
aII too weII.

96
00:11:22,153 --> 00:11:22,869
Rafa.

97
00:11:24,713 --> 00:11:26,351
Don't Iook at her.

98
00:12:19,073 --> 00:12:20,552
Where are you going?

99
00:13:54,713 --> 00:13:56,704
I fucking caIIed you six times,
you moron!

100
00:13:56,913 --> 00:13:57,902
My battery ran out! I'm sorry.

101
00:13:58,113 --> 00:14:00,866
Change of pIan, you have to take
the chickens to VaIencia.

102
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:03,507
Dickhead! I had to come
aII the way out here to teII you!

103
00:14:03,713 --> 00:14:05,226
I'm sorry.

104
00:14:05,433 --> 00:14:07,503
-Fuck!
-AIma...

105
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:08,668
Leave him aIone, you arsehoIe!

106
00:14:09,033 --> 00:14:10,466
Crazy fucking bitch!

107
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:15,221
I'm going to smash your face,
you arsehoIe!

108
00:14:15,433 --> 00:14:17,105
You don't have the baIIs.
Bring it on.

109
00:14:17,313 --> 00:14:18,826
-Came on then! Try it!
-Fuck, Rafa!

110
00:14:19,033 --> 00:14:20,989
Get back in the car!

111
00:14:22,873 --> 00:14:24,192
-What are you doing, AIma?
-Get out of here!

112
00:14:24,393 --> 00:14:26,623
Just you wait, you crazy bitch!

113
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,869
Running off?
I'm standing right here.

114
00:14:29,073 --> 00:14:29,744
You're a fucking nutter!

115
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:31,784
Anytime, champion!

116
00:14:38,033 --> 00:14:40,467
You're crazy!
He couId have reaIIy hurt you!

117
00:14:41,633 --> 00:14:43,464
I don't give a shit.

118
00:14:50,313 --> 00:14:51,428
Rafa.

119
00:14:53,473 --> 00:14:55,350
You're not going to ask me
out tonight?

120
00:14:55,793 --> 00:14:57,306
What the fuck is wrong with you?

121
00:14:57,993 --> 00:14:58,903
Ask me.

122
00:15:03,393 --> 00:15:04,428
Ask me out, Rafa.

123
00:15:37,433 --> 00:15:39,788
You know what the nurse said,
Grandad?

124
00:15:39,993 --> 00:15:41,984
That the Iast thing you forget
are songs.

125
00:15:45,233 --> 00:15:46,791
ShouId we try it?

126
00:15:47,793 --> 00:15:50,023
Let's try a song.

127
00:16:27,273 --> 00:16:29,343
How shouId I put my Iips?
Like this?

128
00:16:29,553 --> 00:16:30,269
Yes.

129
00:16:31,153 --> 00:16:32,108
No!

130
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:35,384
It tickIes.

131
00:16:38,193 --> 00:16:40,707
I'm more scared of you than the dentist!

132
00:17:23,353 --> 00:17:24,388
What are you doing here?

133
00:17:24,593 --> 00:17:25,787
Get off my Iand!

134
00:17:25,993 --> 00:17:27,824
-Dad, we onIy came to...
-Shut up! I know why you're here.

135
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:28,909
Get off my Iand!

136
00:17:29,113 --> 00:17:32,264
And don't come back
or I'II shoot you!

137
00:17:32,473 --> 00:17:33,508
-Leave! Out!
-Take it easy.

138
00:17:33,713 --> 00:17:34,270
Out!

139
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,471
You too, out!

140
00:17:37,393 --> 00:17:38,382
Out!

141
00:17:39,153 --> 00:17:40,825
30 thousand euros, Dad.

142
00:17:41,033 --> 00:17:43,149
5 miIIion pesetas!

143
00:17:43,873 --> 00:17:46,512
You've worked Iike a sIave
your whoIe Iife

144
00:17:46,713 --> 00:17:47,623
and what have you got?

145
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:51,393
There's cheap mixed oiI
ever<i>yw</i>here.

146
00:17:51,593 --> 00:17:54,710
Nobody gives a shit
about your precious oIive oiI!

147
00:17:54,913 --> 00:17:55,629
CaIm down.

148
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,824
It's the truth!
Nobody cares about our work!

149
00:17:58,033 --> 00:18:00,831
Some of your friends have soId
their oIdest trees

150
00:18:01,033 --> 00:18:02,307
for firewood.

151
00:18:02,513 --> 00:18:05,823
We've worked our asses off
our whoIe Iives in those fieIds

152
00:18:06,033 --> 00:18:08,627
and you've never paid us
a penny.

153
00:18:11,113 --> 00:18:11,943
You owe it to us.

154
00:18:16,353 --> 00:18:17,388
What do you think?

155
00:18:20,073 --> 00:18:23,463
I think that I'm not going to seII.

156
00:18:24,393 --> 00:18:26,668
That tree is not ours.

157
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:27,910
Damn it...

158
00:18:28,113 --> 00:18:31,071
It was passed down
from grandparents to parents

159
00:18:31,273 --> 00:18:34,345
and from parents to chiIdren.
If I seII that oIive tree

160
00:18:34,553 --> 00:18:36,305
and give you the money,

161
00:18:36,513 --> 00:18:39,630
next week you won't have the tree,
the money or the restaurant.

162
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:40,390
You just ignore us!

163
00:18:40,593 --> 00:18:44,222
That oIive tree has no price.
It's sacred.

164
00:18:44,433 --> 00:18:48,108
That tree is my Iife and you want
to take my Iife away.

165
00:18:48,433 --> 00:18:50,469
It's onIy a tree!

166
00:18:50,673 --> 00:18:52,265
And we're your chiIdren!

167
00:18:52,473 --> 00:18:54,270
It'II be yours, I can't take it with me!

168
00:18:54,473 --> 00:18:57,146
You're stuck in the past

169
00:18:57,593 --> 00:18:59,470
and you're sinking us aII!

170
00:18:59,673 --> 00:19:03,632
That tree isn't even ours.
It beIongs to Iife, to history.

171
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:07,587
Don't give me that history buIIshit!
We have famiIies to feed!

172
00:19:22,513 --> 00:19:23,946
Grandad!

173
00:19:27,593 --> 00:19:29,584
Grandad!

174
00:19:30,433 --> 00:19:32,185
Grandad!

175
00:19:39,393 --> 00:19:40,746
Grandad!

176
00:19:41,393 --> 00:19:42,906
Grandad!

177
00:20:14,753 --> 00:20:15,742
There's a IittIe girI!

178
00:20:15,953 --> 00:20:17,272
Stop, stop, stop!

179
00:20:17,713 --> 00:20:18,941
Be carefuI!

180
00:20:20,393 --> 00:20:21,303
The girI is up there!

181
00:20:22,033 --> 00:20:23,148
Stop the machine!

182
00:20:23,353 --> 00:20:25,469
-Get down!
-Stop the machine, cut the engine!

183
00:20:25,673 --> 00:20:26,628
Stop!

184
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:27,788
Listen to your mother.

185
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,346
AIma, come down, damn it!

186
00:20:29,553 --> 00:20:31,350
-Come down!
-AIma!

187
00:20:31,913 --> 00:20:32,663
Come down.

188
00:20:32,873 --> 00:20:34,670
Come down!
Get her down, Luis!

189
00:20:34,873 --> 00:20:35,510
Come down!

190
00:20:35,713 --> 00:20:38,466
AIma, come down from there!
Come on.

191
00:20:38,673 --> 00:20:41,665
-Come down!
-Come on, get down.

192
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:43,022
CIimb down, damn it!

193
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,466
-Come on, cIimb down.
-AIma!

194
00:20:47,673 --> 00:20:48,788
Come down!

195
00:21:00,513 --> 00:21:03,630
AIma, come here, darIing.
Don't cry.

196
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:16,667
The monster...

197
00:22:21,793 --> 00:22:24,671
His weight Ioss and deterioration
are very aIarming.

198
00:22:25,273 --> 00:22:29,869
If we can check him into the hospitaI
for a few days, we can run some tests,

199
00:22:30,073 --> 00:22:31,631
stimuIate his appetite

200
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:36,509
and maybe start thinking about
a home with fuII time care.

201
00:22:39,913 --> 00:22:41,824
If it's for the best.

202
00:22:42,513 --> 00:22:45,391
I try to spend as much time
as I can here, but...

203
00:22:45,753 --> 00:22:47,072
it's not enough.

204
00:22:47,393 --> 00:22:50,544
Luis can't do everything himseIf
and aIso watch Dad.

205
00:22:51,153 --> 00:22:53,303
We'II aII be Iess worried.

206
00:22:56,913 --> 00:22:58,187
You're going to kiII him.

207
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:02,587
If he doesn't eat, he'II die.

208
00:23:02,793 --> 00:23:05,148
Your grandfather isn't
your grandfather anymore.

209
00:23:06,393 --> 00:23:07,587
Grandpa is gone, AIma.

210
00:23:07,793 --> 00:23:09,943
There's nothing wrong with him.
Nothing.

211
00:23:10,193 --> 00:23:12,468
You're teIIing a doctor
how to do her job?

212
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:19,626
What do you mean, sweetheart?

213
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:21,061
He's in mourning, that's aII.

214
00:23:21,713 --> 00:23:23,704
Grandma died a Iong time ago.

215
00:23:29,193 --> 00:23:31,388
Not the fucking tree again!

216
00:23:32,073 --> 00:23:35,065
What are you trying to do,
screw up the whoIe famiIy?

217
00:23:49,433 --> 00:23:52,505
It's Iike a Iost chiId, isn't it?

218
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:55,751
The worst part is not knowing.

219
00:23:57,833 --> 00:24:00,950
What if it's in a beautifuI pIace
somewhere?

220
00:24:01,153 --> 00:24:02,108
Eh?

221
00:24:03,033 --> 00:24:04,751
With water,

222
00:24:05,633 --> 00:24:07,703
with peopIe who take care of it...

223
00:24:08,633 --> 00:24:11,306
It wouId be a happy monster, eh?

224
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:17,950
If you knew
wouId you be more at peace?

225
00:24:32,593 --> 00:24:33,912
Grandad, do you want to die?

226
00:24:36,873 --> 00:24:39,182
Is that it?
Do you want to die?

227
00:24:50,553 --> 00:24:51,429
Grandad!

228
00:24:54,113 --> 00:24:56,069
Grandad, I heard you.
I heard you.

229
00:24:56,273 --> 00:24:57,786
Did you sing?
Listen.

230
00:24:57,993 --> 00:24:59,631
<i>Let the wind blow...</i>

231
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:00,868
Did you hear that?

232
00:25:02,153 --> 00:25:03,632
I think it was onIy
a deep breath.

233
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:06,631
No, pIease, I heard you.
Sing with me.

234
00:25:06,833 --> 00:25:09,063
<i>Let the wind blow,</i>
<i>let it blow hard...</i>

235
00:25:09,273 --> 00:25:10,023
PIease, Grandad.

236
00:25:10,233 --> 00:25:11,951
PIease, pIease.

237
00:25:34,793 --> 00:25:35,942
I know you're there.

238
00:25:37,153 --> 00:25:38,506
I know it.

239
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:34,551
It took me and your dad
a whoIe day to put those there.

240
00:26:36,913 --> 00:26:38,107
God!

241
00:26:40,353 --> 00:26:43,265
How did we swaIIow aII that shit?

242
00:26:44,433 --> 00:26:45,707
For what?

243
00:26:46,273 --> 00:26:48,707
-I Iost EstreIIa...
-He Ieft Mum...

244
00:26:48,953 --> 00:26:51,069
No, that's not how it was.

245
00:26:51,273 --> 00:26:54,743
Okay, she Ieft him. Because
he never took care of her.

246
00:26:54,953 --> 00:26:57,467
No wonder she feII apart
and Ieft him.

247
00:26:57,673 --> 00:26:59,470
We worked Iike donkeys.

248
00:26:59,673 --> 00:27:01,629
We aII made mistakes.

249
00:27:02,033 --> 00:27:04,069
And he took care of her,
in his own way.

250
00:27:04,273 --> 00:27:06,025
And how did he treat Grandad?

251
00:27:07,393 --> 00:27:09,748
Have you ever wondered
how Grandad treated him?

252
00:27:11,233 --> 00:27:12,871
Have you?

253
00:27:13,873 --> 00:27:15,943
Because with us he was a very tough
oId man.

254
00:27:16,153 --> 00:27:19,543
We used to say he cared about
his trees more than us.

255
00:27:19,753 --> 00:27:22,267
With you he might have been marveIIous,
not with us.

256
00:27:22,473 --> 00:27:24,191
Okay, Arti, Ieave it!

257
00:27:27,393 --> 00:27:30,112
You know how humiIiating
it must be for your dad

258
00:27:30,313 --> 00:27:33,862
to move back to the famiIy house?
To the same bedroom as a boy?

259
00:27:34,513 --> 00:27:36,026
Put yourseIf in his shoes.

260
00:27:46,033 --> 00:27:48,422
Jesus Christ.
You never give up!

261
00:27:48,913 --> 00:27:51,268
One thing I've never understood, Arti.

262
00:27:51,593 --> 00:27:53,311
At that time,

263
00:27:53,513 --> 00:27:56,471
banks were Ioaning money
to anybody, right?

264
00:27:56,673 --> 00:27:59,551
They say anybody
couId get credit. Okay?

265
00:27:59,753 --> 00:28:02,870
Then why did you need
the 30 thousand for the tree?

266
00:28:10,473 --> 00:28:12,828
It's what the mayor
asked for...

267
00:28:14,393 --> 00:28:16,509
to buiId so cIose to the beach.

268
00:28:18,553 --> 00:28:21,431
Disgusting!
You're aII the fucking same.

269
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:23,544
No, we're not, AIma!

270
00:28:23,753 --> 00:28:25,823
We did it for you and your cousins.

271
00:28:26,033 --> 00:28:28,593
So we couId have a famiIy
business.

272
00:28:28,793 --> 00:28:32,581
Not our choice to bribe the mayor,
that's how things were done.

273
00:28:32,793 --> 00:28:35,261
Sorry we're not aII fucking saints.

274
00:28:36,433 --> 00:28:37,946
We'II see what you do
for your kids.

275
00:28:39,073 --> 00:28:40,711
Look how happy he was.

276
00:28:47,593 --> 00:28:49,026
Look at EmiIio.

277
00:28:50,113 --> 00:28:51,990
What ever became of him?

278
00:28:52,953 --> 00:28:55,547
I stiII remember the drinks
he used to mix.

279
00:28:57,593 --> 00:28:59,265
You know what I remember?

280
00:29:00,673 --> 00:29:04,348
His chubby fingers and bitten naiIs.
That's what.

281
00:29:05,193 --> 00:29:08,230
He used to stick them down my pants
when I was waitressing here.

282
00:29:11,193 --> 00:29:14,583
I tried to teII Dad aII summer.
The whoIe summer.

283
00:29:15,673 --> 00:29:17,903
I was so ashamed
that I couIdn't...

284
00:29:20,193 --> 00:29:23,344
One night I toId him.
In the kitchen.

285
00:29:25,753 --> 00:29:27,266
Know what your brother said?

286
00:29:30,313 --> 00:29:31,223
Nothing.

287
00:29:31,713 --> 00:29:33,590
He didn't say a word.

288
00:29:34,233 --> 00:29:35,985
And he waIked out.

289
00:29:36,913 --> 00:29:39,507
AIma, he must have been...

290
00:29:42,033 --> 00:29:44,786
He must have froze.
He didn't know what to do.

291
00:29:46,913 --> 00:29:48,551
Go to heII.

292
00:29:49,233 --> 00:29:52,225
You and your brother can both
go to fucking heII.

293
00:29:52,433 --> 00:29:54,947
He didn't know what to do?

294
00:29:55,153 --> 00:29:56,506
It's very easy!

295
00:29:56,713 --> 00:29:59,546
Protect your daughter,
arsehoIe!

296
00:30:12,673 --> 00:30:15,585
I have no idea.
Some went aII the way to China,

297
00:30:15,793 --> 00:30:18,785
the MiddIe East, aII over Europe,
even the Vatican.

298
00:30:18,993 --> 00:30:20,346
Thousands of them.

299
00:30:20,553 --> 00:30:23,226
Over a hundred
went to one bank in Madrid.

300
00:30:23,433 --> 00:30:25,185
Yeah, but I have the saIe date.

301
00:30:25,393 --> 00:30:27,987
I onIy want to know
where it is, who bought it...

302
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:30,343
Who do you think I am,
InterpoI?

303
00:30:32,113 --> 00:30:33,626
Go on, get out of here.

304
00:30:34,113 --> 00:30:36,149
We're not serving hippies today.

305
00:30:36,713 --> 00:30:37,828
Do you remember me?

306
00:30:40,073 --> 00:30:42,587
I was in the tree, I cIimbed up
whiIe you were uprooting it.

307
00:30:43,353 --> 00:30:46,425
You were shouting at me.
I was onIy 8 years oId.

308
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:48,869
Just get the fuck out of here.

309
00:30:50,153 --> 00:30:52,508
Your famiIy made 30 thousand euros.

310
00:30:52,713 --> 00:30:54,271
Consider yourseIves Iucky.

311
00:30:55,233 --> 00:30:56,985
You know what?

312
00:30:57,193 --> 00:30:59,548
I'd start Iooking for your tree in China!
Beat it.

313
00:30:59,873 --> 00:31:01,511
I remember everything.

314
00:31:01,713 --> 00:31:04,181
EspeciaIIy that pig-face
of yours.

315
00:31:11,873 --> 00:31:13,545
Go on, piss off!

316
00:31:32,833 --> 00:31:34,744
Your name is AIma, isn't it?

317
00:31:34,953 --> 00:31:35,783
Yeah.

318
00:31:38,433 --> 00:31:39,832
I was there that day.

319
00:31:40,313 --> 00:31:42,463
I was in the car.
I went with my brother.

320
00:31:42,673 --> 00:31:44,425
Yes, he's my brother.

321
00:31:46,793 --> 00:31:48,590
I'II never forget it.

322
00:31:50,313 --> 00:31:52,429
Your grandfather's tree
was very speciaI,

323
00:31:52,633 --> 00:31:56,228
but many die within the first 15 years
of transpIant,

324
00:31:56,433 --> 00:31:59,470
so you might never find it.

325
00:32:00,313 --> 00:32:01,826
But this couId heIp.

326
00:32:07,473 --> 00:32:09,065
That's it, isn't it?

327
00:32:11,593 --> 00:32:12,628
Yes.

328
00:32:13,913 --> 00:32:14,789
Thank you.

329
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:27,905
DusseIdorf, Germany.

330
00:32:31,153 --> 00:32:31,903
Wow!

331
00:32:32,113 --> 00:32:34,024
It's a huge company.

332
00:32:40,633 --> 00:32:41,986
There it is!

333
00:32:42,553 --> 00:32:44,225
It's in the middIe of the Iobby,

334
00:32:44,953 --> 00:32:46,864
Pride of pIace!

335
00:32:48,113 --> 00:32:50,263
-It's a star.
-What's the date?

336
00:32:51,353 --> 00:32:54,709
The website is up to date,
must stiII be there.

337
00:32:54,913 --> 00:32:57,871
HoIy shit! They're using it
as the company Iogo!

338
00:32:58,313 --> 00:33:00,781
Your grandfather wiII be
super proud.

339
00:33:00,993 --> 00:33:02,665
It wiII kiII him.

340
00:33:03,473 --> 00:33:05,350
Fucking Iocked up, no fresh air!

341
00:33:05,553 --> 00:33:07,623
AIma, it's not a tiger,
doesn't need to run around.

342
00:33:08,393 --> 00:33:12,432
It Iooks super cooI, in one of the most
important countries in the worId.

343
00:33:13,793 --> 00:33:15,465
It'II break his heart.

344
00:33:18,273 --> 00:33:20,912
That's Adri. I'm going, okay?
See you Iater.

345
00:33:21,113 --> 00:33:24,389
Ok, Photoshop, I can put it
where you want.

346
00:33:24,593 --> 00:33:26,868
How about outside in a garden?

347
00:33:27,313 --> 00:33:30,669
LittIe white Iie so he doesn't suffer
and he'II never know.

348
00:33:31,153 --> 00:33:33,144
That's the probIem, he knows.

349
00:33:33,953 --> 00:33:35,102
How couId he know?

350
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:37,508
He can't even taIk.

351
00:33:39,193 --> 00:33:41,946
Wiki, he knows and I'm not
going to Iie to him.

352
00:33:43,073 --> 00:33:46,349
Okay, fine.
Then what do we do?

353
00:34:59,193 --> 00:35:00,308
Grandpa.

354
00:35:03,113 --> 00:35:04,785
I know where it is.

355
00:35:20,073 --> 00:35:22,667
I don't know how,
but I'm going to bring it back.

356
00:35:25,393 --> 00:35:28,669
I'II bring it back, I promise.

357
00:35:30,313 --> 00:35:31,905
HoId on, Grandad.

358
00:35:34,073 --> 00:35:36,906
HoId on, pIease,
I'II bring it back for you.

359
00:35:46,233 --> 00:35:49,430
Mr. Gorbicht was German,

360
00:35:49,633 --> 00:35:52,784
retired, very rich, who moved
to VaIencia. And very reIigious.

361
00:35:52,993 --> 00:35:55,302
And since the oIive tree
is sacred in the BibIe,

362
00:35:55,513 --> 00:35:59,711
he had a dream to donate
an ancient tree to his church.

363
00:35:59,913 --> 00:36:03,064
From the time of Christ.
And which tree did he pick?

364
00:36:05,993 --> 00:36:07,346
My grandad's.

365
00:36:09,393 --> 00:36:12,510
Mr. Gorbicht died 4 years ago

366
00:36:12,873 --> 00:36:15,671
I got this Ietter from
the minister at his church,

367
00:36:15,873 --> 00:36:19,343
the San Lucas Church
in DusseIdorf, Germany.

368
00:36:20,313 --> 00:36:22,269
Here's what he says:

369
00:36:24,193 --> 00:36:25,546
Quiet everybody.

370
00:36:25,753 --> 00:36:27,948
She's taIking about Ramón.

371
00:36:28,153 --> 00:36:31,668
''I've spoken with my parishioners.
When we accepted Mr. Gorbicht's donation,

372
00:36:31,873 --> 00:36:35,661
our intentions were weII meant,
but a mistake.

373
00:36:35,873 --> 00:36:38,068
Many young members
of our community

374
00:36:38,273 --> 00:36:41,345
are aware of the sacredness of nature,
and the environment,

375
00:36:41,553 --> 00:36:43,066
so after much prayer,

376
00:36:43,433 --> 00:36:46,391
we have made a decision.
We wouId Iike

377
00:36:46,593 --> 00:36:49,744
this sacred tree to bring peace
and harmony to your famiIy,

378
00:36:49,953 --> 00:36:53,707
especiaIIy to the eIderIy gentIeman
who has cared for it his entire Iife.

379
00:36:53,913 --> 00:36:59,226
CIearIy, it shouId be returned to
the spot where it was pIanted and grew.''

380
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,072
They're giving it back!

381
00:37:07,913 --> 00:37:09,187
He speaks great Spanish.

382
00:37:10,073 --> 00:37:14,271
Yeah... He was a missionary
in GuatemaIa for 25 years.

383
00:37:15,593 --> 00:37:16,992
-You taIked to him?
-Yeah.

384
00:37:18,193 --> 00:37:20,423
And where is the tree?

385
00:37:20,953 --> 00:37:22,022
In DusseIdorf.

386
00:37:23,433 --> 00:37:26,743
In the church gardens,
by the River Rhine.

387
00:37:28,153 --> 00:37:30,269
How did you find it?

388
00:37:30,553 --> 00:37:32,145
The garden centre toId me.

389
00:37:36,073 --> 00:37:38,029
Shit! And here's me thinking the Germans

390
00:37:38,233 --> 00:37:41,384
were a bunch of greedy fuckers
who came down here

391
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:45,632
in their oId age to get their piIes
sorted on our heaIth system!

392
00:37:46,753 --> 00:37:48,789
I apoIogize!

393
00:37:49,993 --> 00:37:54,066
Now aII we need is one truck
with a crane and two drivers.

394
00:37:54,673 --> 00:37:57,233
To DusseIdorf?
Cost a fortune!

395
00:37:57,433 --> 00:38:01,221
It's way, way up there, AIma.
Lots of countries in between.

396
00:38:01,433 --> 00:38:04,027
It's 1,659 kiIometres.
That's not so far.

397
00:38:04,233 --> 00:38:06,747
We can take advantage of
the hoIiday weekend coming up.

398
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,108
What do you mean, ''we''?

399
00:38:10,593 --> 00:38:13,630
-If you borrow your boss' truck...
-What?

400
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:16,825
You can take turns driving
and be back before he notices.

401
00:38:17,033 --> 00:38:19,467
Borrow a 250,000 euro truck

402
00:38:19,673 --> 00:38:21,823
from the psychopath
you just peIted with eggs?

403
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:23,864
NeIson wiII cut your baIIs off.

404
00:38:25,473 --> 00:38:26,144
Hey...

405
00:38:26,633 --> 00:38:27,543
No.

406
00:38:30,393 --> 00:38:34,830
-And it's my wedding anniversary!
-But you're divorced!

407
00:38:35,033 --> 00:38:37,103
But we stiII Iove each other.

408
00:38:37,513 --> 00:38:40,949
If EstreIIa finds out I went
to DusseIdorf for a tree...

409
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:42,268
No way.

410
00:38:42,473 --> 00:38:44,941
DieseI, insurance, toIIs...
AII that expense.

411
00:38:45,153 --> 00:38:47,223
Ijust soId my motorcycIe
for 1,000 euros.

412
00:38:47,433 --> 00:38:48,343
Right.

413
00:38:51,593 --> 00:38:53,982
That's not enough.
What about the permits?

414
00:38:54,193 --> 00:38:57,105
You don't need permits.
Open borders.

415
00:38:59,073 --> 00:38:59,983
Grandad's dying!

416
00:39:00,193 --> 00:39:03,503
He can't even remember
his own chiIdren!

417
00:39:03,713 --> 00:39:05,146
He'II remember the tree, damn it!

418
00:39:05,353 --> 00:39:08,504
AIma, you're too upset.
Too emotionaI.

419
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:13,264
Let's think it over. We're taIking about
a 14 ton Ioad!

420
00:39:13,873 --> 00:39:17,707
If I have to waIk aII the way there
and drag it back myseIf, I wiII.

421
00:39:17,913 --> 00:39:20,381
You can both go fuck yourseIves!

422
00:39:20,593 --> 00:39:21,264
AIma!

423
00:39:21,473 --> 00:39:23,589
-Wait!
-Don't touch me!

424
00:39:24,113 --> 00:39:26,183
We'II taIk it over, AIma!

425
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:30,349
She's mad as a hatter.

426
00:39:33,073 --> 00:39:34,825
I soId an oIive tree too.

427
00:39:35,033 --> 00:39:37,069
Fuss about nothing.

428
00:39:45,593 --> 00:39:47,788
Try it, whet your appetite.

429
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:50,711
Come on, Dad.

430
00:40:23,153 --> 00:40:24,268
They never stop eating!

431
00:40:24,473 --> 00:40:26,543
From chick to chicken in 40 days.

432
00:40:26,753 --> 00:40:30,063
I'm going to puke!
I'm a vegetarian, AIma.

433
00:40:30,273 --> 00:40:33,549
Asking you to feed them,
not eat them.

434
00:40:33,753 --> 00:40:36,984
It's easy, AdeIIe.
Press a few buttons, that's it.

435
00:40:37,193 --> 00:40:39,582
I wrote it aII down for you.
Here, take it.

436
00:40:39,793 --> 00:40:41,351
What if they expIode?

437
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,150
HardIy ever happens.
This one's dead.

438
00:40:44,353 --> 00:40:46,344
Get that thing away from me!

439
00:40:46,553 --> 00:40:48,464
-They have to be picked up.
-Disgusting!

440
00:40:51,793 --> 00:40:52,862
It touched me!

441
00:40:54,033 --> 00:40:55,591
Disgusting!

442
00:40:56,953 --> 00:40:57,863
Disgusting!

443
00:40:58,073 --> 00:40:59,745
I contacted a website
for Spaniards abroad

444
00:40:59,953 --> 00:41:03,741
and spoke to SoIe,
a Spanish girI in DusseIdorf.

445
00:41:03,953 --> 00:41:05,272
She'II caII you Iater on Skype.

446
00:41:05,473 --> 00:41:09,148
You're a genius, Wiki, thanks.
What about the energy company?

447
00:41:09,353 --> 00:41:14,507
I've sent emaiIs to the CEO and
the head of each department, but nothing.

448
00:41:14,713 --> 00:41:16,783
I've caIIed 40 times.
They just Iaugh and hang up.

449
00:41:16,993 --> 00:41:20,622
I don't think you'II get
an<i>yw</i>here near the tree.

450
00:41:22,593 --> 00:41:23,628
Phew.

451
00:41:25,913 --> 00:41:27,266
AIma.

452
00:41:27,473 --> 00:41:30,510
Stay a few days Ionger
and we'II think this through.

453
00:41:30,713 --> 00:41:32,590
I can't, Grandad's worse.

454
00:41:32,793 --> 00:41:35,466
Going without a pIan
is stupid.

455
00:41:35,673 --> 00:41:36,822
Then keep thinking.

456
00:41:38,873 --> 00:41:41,262
Wiki, you've got the brains
I've got the brass neck.

457
00:41:43,113 --> 00:41:44,387
And you've got the chickens.

458
00:41:44,593 --> 00:41:46,629
-You're crazy.
-You shouId be Iocked up.

459
00:41:46,833 --> 00:41:48,664
Fine, I know!

460
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:52,185
None of this makes any sense,
I can see that.

461
00:41:52,953 --> 00:41:55,626
But sometimes you just have
to dive in.

462
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:57,266
Headfirst.

463
00:41:57,833 --> 00:41:59,551
You begin the journey...

464
00:42:00,633 --> 00:42:02,191
and peopIe wiII heIp you
aIong the way.

465
00:42:02,393 --> 00:42:03,985
Why shouId they heIp you?

466
00:42:13,073 --> 00:42:14,062
-Here, take it.
-No, no.

467
00:42:14,273 --> 00:42:16,833
-Yes.
-From both of us,

468
00:42:17,033 --> 00:42:18,546
just in case.

469
00:42:30,313 --> 00:42:33,749
I'II be fine, okay?
Nothing wiII happen to me.

470
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:45,229
HoIy shit! Look at them.

471
00:42:45,433 --> 00:42:47,105
Like Iambs to the sIaughter.

472
00:42:47,313 --> 00:42:49,952
Not a cIue of the mess
you've got them into.

473
00:42:50,153 --> 00:42:52,223
You have to teII them.
They'II go crazy.

474
00:42:52,433 --> 00:42:54,503
No, not a word.

475
00:42:54,713 --> 00:42:57,068
If I teII them now,
they'II be off, back home.

476
00:42:57,633 --> 00:43:01,103
Just think of something
and skype me Iater.

477
00:43:15,193 --> 00:43:16,512
WeII, what do you think?

478
00:43:16,713 --> 00:43:17,782
What do I think?

479
00:43:17,993 --> 00:43:20,063
What kept you? That's what I think.

480
00:43:22,913 --> 00:43:24,232
I'II be damned.

481
00:43:57,473 --> 00:43:58,986
Ricardo, Iisten to me.

482
00:43:59,193 --> 00:44:01,104
He went to Madrid
with his girIfriend.

483
00:44:01,313 --> 00:44:03,110
He won't be back for 3 days.

484
00:44:03,313 --> 00:44:05,986
<i>l was wrong.</i>
<i>l want the truck back now.</i>

485
00:44:06,193 --> 00:44:09,026
We're on the road!
CaIm down.

486
00:44:09,233 --> 00:44:10,905
I'II keep you posted,
I promise.

487
00:44:11,113 --> 00:44:13,502
-<i>Where did you say?</i>
-Granada. It'II be fine.

488
00:44:13,713 --> 00:44:15,146
Got a bad feeIing
about this.

489
00:44:15,353 --> 00:44:17,787
Don't worry, it'II be fine.
Trust me.

490
00:44:19,113 --> 00:44:21,024
Okay, taIk to you Iater.
Bye.

491
00:44:21,913 --> 00:44:25,349
That was the security guard
at the garage. Shitting himseIf.

492
00:44:26,113 --> 00:44:27,910
But he's a good Iad.

493
00:44:28,113 --> 00:44:29,831
He wanted to heIp me out.

494
00:44:32,593 --> 00:44:34,424
About this German minister.

495
00:44:34,913 --> 00:44:36,312
You have got his address?

496
00:44:37,553 --> 00:44:39,191
Any more stupid questions?

497
00:44:41,913 --> 00:44:44,427
Don't shit me, AIma.
It's a Iong, Iong way.

498
00:44:44,633 --> 00:44:46,032
What if he changes his mind?

499
00:44:46,233 --> 00:44:49,384
Come on!
He's a minister, protestant, German.

500
00:44:49,593 --> 00:44:51,948
Can you imagine anyone more serious?

501
00:44:52,153 --> 00:44:52,949
Okay, then.

502
00:44:56,833 --> 00:45:00,906
<i>Granada, land of my dreams...</i>

503
00:45:02,753 --> 00:45:06,871
Granada he says, what a dick!
I'II be damned!

504
00:45:15,313 --> 00:45:17,190
<i>Hi, l'm Sole.</i>

505
00:45:17,393 --> 00:45:19,907
<i>This is Katrine,</i>
<i>a law student.</i>

506
00:45:20,713 --> 00:45:21,668
<i>This is Marine.</i>

507
00:45:22,113 --> 00:45:23,785
-Hi.
-<i>This is Sophie.</i>

508
00:45:23,993 --> 00:45:28,305
<i>She's a social media manager and</i>
<i>likes getting into trouble sometimes.</i>

509
00:45:28,513 --> 00:45:31,107
<i>Have you heard back from</i>
<i>the energy company yet?</i>

510
00:45:31,313 --> 00:45:34,146
No, my friends have tried caIIing
but they're brushing us off.

511
00:45:34,353 --> 00:45:36,150
<i>She hasn't heard back.</i>

512
00:45:36,353 --> 00:45:37,342
They think it's a joke.

513
00:45:37,553 --> 00:45:38,827
No wonder.

514
00:45:39,033 --> 00:45:42,150
<i>l wrote to the CEO of the company</i>

515
00:45:42,353 --> 00:45:44,742
<i>and offered to pay them back</i>
<i>for the tree,</i>

516
00:45:44,953 --> 00:45:47,592
<i>like a loan, with interest,</i>
<i>but...</i>

517
00:45:47,793 --> 00:45:51,786
She offered to buy the tree

518
00:45:51,993 --> 00:45:53,426
and pay in instaIIments.

519
00:45:53,633 --> 00:45:55,863
How naive!
It's embarrassing.

520
00:45:56,073 --> 00:45:59,110
Coming aII the way from Spain
without a pIan!

521
00:45:59,313 --> 00:46:02,510
The tree is in their headquarters.
It's their fucking Iogo!

522
00:46:02,713 --> 00:46:05,352
<i>They paid 30,000 for it.</i>
<i>ls she crazy or what?</i>

523
00:46:05,553 --> 00:46:06,668
She says I'm crazy, right?

524
00:46:08,313 --> 00:46:09,462
<i>lt's a bit too much, Alma.</i>

525
00:46:09,673 --> 00:46:12,187
<i>Do you really think you can</i>
<i>come and pick up the tree,</i>

526
00:46:12,393 --> 00:46:13,826
<i>just like that?</i>

527
00:46:14,033 --> 00:46:17,628
That's the probIem,
the guys with me do.

528
00:46:18,033 --> 00:46:18,943
<i>What do you mean?</i>

529
00:46:19,153 --> 00:46:20,711
<i>l told them a lie.</i>

530
00:46:20,913 --> 00:46:24,189
<i>l told them the tree is at a church</i>
<i>and they're giving it back.</i>

531
00:46:24,393 --> 00:46:25,064
No fucking way!

532
00:46:26,473 --> 00:46:30,671
The guys with her don't know.

533
00:46:30,873 --> 00:46:34,149
This girI is fucking brainIess.

534
00:46:34,353 --> 00:46:36,230
You can count me out.
Forget it.

535
00:46:36,713 --> 00:46:39,432
<i>Look, l know it's crazy.</i>
<i>But l couldn't just sit there</i>

536
00:46:39,633 --> 00:46:41,385
<i>and watch my grandfather</i>
<i>die of heartbreak.</i>

537
00:46:41,593 --> 00:46:42,742
<i>Do you understand?</i>
<i>l couldn't.</i>

538
00:46:45,033 --> 00:46:46,864
<i>Wiki sent us photos.</i>

539
00:46:47,233 --> 00:46:49,303
<i>l'm sorry about your grandfather.</i>

540
00:46:51,593 --> 00:46:54,027
<i>Can you please help me?</i>

541
00:47:00,313 --> 00:47:04,306
I didn't know.
I didn't see it coming.

542
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:07,911
I had six huge trucks
Iike this one

543
00:47:08,113 --> 00:47:10,866
worth two miIIion.
I was owed a fortune.

544
00:47:11,073 --> 00:47:13,667
One day I was somebody,
the next a nobody.

545
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:16,433
It aII vanished, Iike that.
No warning.

546
00:47:16,633 --> 00:47:17,748
You must have known.

547
00:47:17,953 --> 00:47:19,625
No, sweetheart.

548
00:47:20,993 --> 00:47:22,392
They Iied to me.

549
00:47:22,593 --> 00:47:24,424
They Iied to me.

550
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:26,544
I Iied to myseIf.

551
00:47:26,753 --> 00:47:28,471
I Iied to EstreIIa.

552
00:47:28,673 --> 00:47:33,189
The Iies got bigger and bigger.
More Iies and more Iies.

553
00:47:33,393 --> 00:47:35,463
I couIdn't stop Iying.

554
00:47:36,593 --> 00:47:40,825
One day, EstreIIa
totaIIy smashed up the kitchen.

555
00:47:41,033 --> 00:47:44,548
The whoIe country
is Iying to itseIf.

556
00:47:47,953 --> 00:47:49,705
That's what she said.

557
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:52,027
And she Ieft me.

558
00:47:54,793 --> 00:47:56,863
So I decided to change my Iife.

559
00:47:57,793 --> 00:48:02,662
I promised. I swore on our son's Iife
that I wouId never Iie to her again.

560
00:48:02,873 --> 00:48:05,023
That I wouId aIways teII the truth.

561
00:48:05,233 --> 00:48:07,986
And yesterday I went to her house
and said:

562
00:48:09,473 --> 00:48:11,668
''Look, EstreIIa. I'm going
to miss our anniversary

563
00:48:11,873 --> 00:48:13,989
because I'm going to DusseIdorf.

564
00:48:15,033 --> 00:48:16,910
WeII done, Arti.

565
00:48:17,153 --> 00:48:19,587
You toId her the truth.

566
00:48:20,193 --> 00:48:22,024
She burst out crying.

567
00:48:22,713 --> 00:48:24,863
She thought I was getting paid.

568
00:48:26,033 --> 00:48:27,785
Did you expIain to her?

569
00:48:28,393 --> 00:48:32,227
My Iips stuck fast, Rafa.
GIued shut.

570
00:48:32,433 --> 00:48:34,901
You moron! She's going
to find out when you get back.

571
00:48:35,113 --> 00:48:37,547
I'm such a fucking idiot!

572
00:48:37,753 --> 00:48:40,142
Disgusted with myseIf.

573
00:48:40,393 --> 00:48:43,590
I couId have toId her.
I couId have said: ''Look, EstreIIa.

574
00:48:43,793 --> 00:48:48,184
I'm picking up the tree in DusseIdorf,
I'II be back two days.

575
00:48:48,393 --> 00:48:51,271
She'd have caIIed me a dunce
but she'd have understood.

576
00:48:51,473 --> 00:48:55,546
But in the moment
I fucking Iied to her again!

577
00:48:57,593 --> 00:49:00,710
Why can't we just trust each other?

578
00:49:00,913 --> 00:49:04,667
Look each other in the eye,
put the cards on the deck?

579
00:49:04,873 --> 00:49:06,352
Be honest with each other?

580
00:49:07,993 --> 00:49:10,461
Work it out together?

581
00:49:12,073 --> 00:49:13,506
Am I right, darIing?

582
00:49:14,153 --> 00:49:15,347
Arti...

583
00:49:16,113 --> 00:49:17,182
Son of a bitch...!

584
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:22,186
What are you doing?

585
00:49:22,393 --> 00:49:24,907
There's a wanker Iives up here
who owes me 90 grand.

586
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:32,064
Answer, you fucker.

587
00:49:32,553 --> 00:49:33,986
Answer.

588
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:37,986
I know you're there.

589
00:49:42,473 --> 00:49:45,271
Come out, you bastard!
I know you're in there!

590
00:49:45,473 --> 00:49:47,543
Show your face,
you piece of shit!

591
00:49:47,753 --> 00:49:48,310
Arti.

592
00:49:48,513 --> 00:49:49,992
We're wasting time.

593
00:49:50,193 --> 00:49:55,426
No, no. I bet the motherfucker
is spying on us

594
00:49:55,633 --> 00:49:58,545
with a teIescope from a bunker,
the bastard.

595
00:49:58,833 --> 00:50:00,585
StiII has the fancy car.

596
00:50:01,753 --> 00:50:04,950
He says it's his brother-in-Iaw's.
And the house his mother-in-Iaw's.

597
00:50:05,153 --> 00:50:08,111
You Iying piece of shit!
Bastard!

598
00:50:08,313 --> 00:50:09,507
And this?

599
00:50:09,713 --> 00:50:14,150
What about this? He bought it
for his idiot girIfriend.

600
00:50:14,353 --> 00:50:17,026
Because she Ioved shopping
in New York.

601
00:50:17,353 --> 00:50:19,947
That's what things were Iike
in those days.

602
00:50:20,193 --> 00:50:22,184
Weekend shopping in New York!

603
00:50:22,393 --> 00:50:24,349
CaIm down and Iet's go.

604
00:50:25,233 --> 00:50:29,511
My sweaty 18 hours a day
working my arse off

605
00:50:29,753 --> 00:50:32,392
so he couId buy this big Iump of junk!

606
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:35,388
He stiII owes me 90 grand.

607
00:50:35,913 --> 00:50:37,585
90 grand!

608
00:50:45,913 --> 00:50:48,985
I'II show the motherfucker.

609
00:50:50,593 --> 00:50:52,185
Where are you going?

610
00:51:07,713 --> 00:51:10,511
What I'm saying, you moron,
is that Germans

611
00:51:10,713 --> 00:51:13,227
-Iove American stuff.
-Do you understand your idiot uncIe?

612
00:51:13,753 --> 00:51:16,028
We'II seII the statue
for a fortune there.

613
00:51:16,233 --> 00:51:18,189
What are you taIking about?

614
00:51:18,393 --> 00:51:21,430
Like aII those gnomes they buy
for their front gardens.

615
00:51:21,633 --> 00:51:25,023
TeII Wiki to find a rich German
and we'II seII it on the Internet.

616
00:51:25,233 --> 00:51:25,790
Okay.

617
00:51:26,193 --> 00:51:29,981
Hey, maybe we can
pass by DisneyIand in Paris

618
00:51:30,193 --> 00:51:31,626
and pick up a Mickey Mouse?

619
00:51:46,833 --> 00:51:48,551
Two thousand years!

620
00:51:49,393 --> 00:51:51,429
He reminds me of my grandfather.

621
00:51:53,113 --> 00:51:56,185
Look at that.
It's not just a ''thing'' to him.

622
00:51:57,233 --> 00:51:58,382
It's sacred.

623
00:52:06,713 --> 00:52:09,147
Something isn't right here.

624
00:52:09,353 --> 00:52:10,832
What isn't right?

625
00:52:11,033 --> 00:52:16,312
CentraI Heating or a hot shower?
What wouId we do without them?

626
00:52:19,193 --> 00:52:20,592
What do you make of her?

627
00:52:21,433 --> 00:52:23,503
It aII sounds a bit daft,

628
00:52:23,713 --> 00:52:25,829
but she gets me.

629
00:52:26,033 --> 00:52:27,785
She's a Iiar.

630
00:52:27,993 --> 00:52:31,622
She tricked her friends to come
to Germany for something that's not theirs.

631
00:52:31,833 --> 00:52:34,267
But she has a point!

632
00:52:34,473 --> 00:52:35,952
I couId open a page on Facebook.

633
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:40,032
WouIdn't take Iong.
See what happens.

634
00:52:40,233 --> 00:52:41,382
It's a good story.

635
00:52:41,633 --> 00:52:43,624
Some peopIe make things happen.

636
00:52:43,833 --> 00:52:46,393
Yeah, right. The worId is fuII
of irritating cIowns.

637
00:52:46,593 --> 00:52:47,787
Katrin!

638
00:53:22,113 --> 00:53:23,785
FRANCE

639
00:54:08,553 --> 00:54:09,303
See who it is.

640
00:54:12,313 --> 00:54:13,462
Your brother.

641
00:54:18,833 --> 00:54:19,948
Your father.

642
00:54:20,593 --> 00:54:22,948
And he aIways wiII be, AIma.

643
00:54:35,273 --> 00:54:37,946
When I first toId him,
he couIdn't beIieve it.

644
00:54:39,073 --> 00:54:41,029
You know what he said?

645
00:54:42,433 --> 00:54:43,752
How brave you were.

646
00:54:44,233 --> 00:54:45,825
More than I can say for him.

647
00:54:49,113 --> 00:54:50,910
He's onIy trying to heIp.

648
00:54:51,953 --> 00:54:55,150
It's his way of saying sorry.
That's not so terribIe, is it?

649
00:55:02,433 --> 00:55:03,502
AIma.

650
00:55:04,193 --> 00:55:05,262
Take it easy.

651
00:55:45,033 --> 00:55:49,629
Open cast mining,
chopping down forests, moving viIIages...

652
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,231
''SustainabiIity.''

653
00:55:52,433 --> 00:55:54,469
And their Iogo is a tree...
What hypocrites!

654
00:55:55,233 --> 00:55:56,951
How's the Facebook page going?

655
00:55:57,153 --> 00:55:59,747
More interest than I expected.

656
00:56:01,033 --> 00:56:04,150
There is an activist group
against the tree feIIing of the company.

657
00:56:04,353 --> 00:56:05,468
They're passing on our page.

658
00:56:05,713 --> 00:56:08,830
Others just think she's crazy.

659
00:56:23,233 --> 00:56:25,428
<i>Lots of people angry with</i>
<i>RRR's hypocrisy.</i>

660
00:56:25,633 --> 00:56:28,431
<i>We can organize something.</i>
<i>l need photos of the trip for FB.</i>

661
00:56:37,553 --> 00:56:39,066
You keep your mouth shut.

662
00:56:41,953 --> 00:56:43,671
I reaIIy Iike that.

663
00:56:44,873 --> 00:56:46,943
Not asking questions
the whoIe time.

664
00:56:50,353 --> 00:56:51,991
Good just to be in siIence.

665
00:56:53,153 --> 00:56:55,428
WeII, you don't Iisten much.

666
00:56:56,473 --> 00:56:58,031
I don't take it personaI anymore.

667
00:57:00,353 --> 00:57:02,867
You've got too much
going on up there.

668
00:57:14,753 --> 00:57:15,902
Stop.

669
00:57:19,833 --> 00:57:22,063
Shit, Rafa.
I'm sorry, I can't.

670
00:57:23,753 --> 00:57:25,709
But you can with a stranger.

671
00:58:09,113 --> 00:58:10,626
<i>Alma, this is getting crazy.</i>

672
00:58:10,833 --> 00:58:13,472
<i>A local paper saw</i>
<i>the Facebook page.</i>

673
00:58:13,673 --> 00:58:15,743
<i>They want to talk to you.</i>
<i>Can l give them your number?</i>

674
00:58:15,953 --> 00:58:18,945
<i>And your dad is driving me crazy.</i>
<i>He came to talk to me.</i>

675
00:58:21,433 --> 00:58:23,993
-What am I going to do?
-<i>l don't know.</i>

676
00:58:24,193 --> 00:58:27,390
<i>This is exactly what l said</i>
<i>right before you left.</i>

677
00:58:27,913 --> 00:58:29,312
<i>What did the guys say?</i>

678
00:58:32,193 --> 00:58:33,706
<i>Alma...</i>

679
00:58:34,713 --> 00:58:36,669
<i>Fuck!</i>
<i>You haven't told them!</i>

680
00:58:36,873 --> 00:58:38,625
<i>Rafa's risking his job!</i>

681
00:58:39,273 --> 00:58:42,788
<i>Show him a little respect</i>
<i>and tell him, shit!</i>

682
00:58:55,593 --> 00:58:57,424
Rafa's taIking to his boss.

683
00:58:57,633 --> 00:58:59,544
He had a fight with his girIfriend
and he came back.

684
00:59:00,113 --> 00:59:01,432
He says he wants his truck.

685
00:59:03,513 --> 00:59:05,788
Come on, we have to make
a decision.

686
00:59:12,993 --> 00:59:15,063
<i>l'm going to rip your head off!</i>

687
00:59:15,273 --> 00:59:18,549
<i>Do you realize what you've done?</i>
<i>You're going to ruin me!</i>

688
00:59:18,753 --> 00:59:20,584
<i>Answer me, you fucking clown!</i>

689
00:59:20,793 --> 00:59:22,465
One more insuIt
and I'II hang up on you.

690
00:59:22,673 --> 00:59:24,106
<i>Where the fuck are you?</i>

691
00:59:24,313 --> 00:59:26,986
Shut up!
And mind your manners.

692
00:59:27,193 --> 00:59:28,546
I'm going to DusseIdorf.

693
00:59:28,753 --> 00:59:32,109
<i>What did you say?</i>
<i>You mean Dusseldorf, in Germany?</i>

694
00:59:32,313 --> 00:59:33,905
<i>Fucking hell!</i>

695
00:59:34,113 --> 00:59:36,468
Listen, this is aII my fauIt.
I Iied to Ricardo.

696
00:59:36,673 --> 00:59:39,745
If you fire him, I'II seII your truck
to the Russian mafia.

697
00:59:39,953 --> 00:59:40,544
Rafa, cooI it.

698
00:59:40,753 --> 00:59:44,063
<i>What the hell...?</i>
<i>l'm going to cut your balls off!</i>

699
00:59:44,273 --> 00:59:46,548
-I'II teII you something, NeIson.
-Rafa, don't...

700
00:59:46,753 --> 00:59:49,631
You're a buIIy, an arsehoIe
and you can go fuck yourseIf!

701
00:59:54,193 --> 00:59:55,626
You just Iost your job, shit.

702
00:59:55,833 --> 00:59:56,629
I don't care!

703
00:59:59,873 --> 01:00:02,387
I'II find something eIse.
Maybe I'II stay in DusseIdorf.

704
01:00:02,833 --> 01:00:04,983
No. I want you both to go back.
Let me taIk to him.

705
01:00:05,793 --> 01:00:07,465
I'II say this was aII a mistake

706
01:00:07,673 --> 01:00:09,584
and that I Iied to you guys.

707
01:00:09,793 --> 01:00:13,581
Let me taIk to him. I'II apoIogize,
return the truck and he'II forgive you.

708
01:00:13,793 --> 01:00:14,350
I can't bear it.

709
01:00:14,553 --> 01:00:15,702
Give me your phone.

710
01:00:16,753 --> 01:00:17,549
-Give it to me.
-No.

711
01:00:17,753 --> 01:00:19,584
Give me your fucking phone!

712
01:00:19,953 --> 01:00:22,945
-Give it to me!
-That's enough! Fuck!

713
01:00:25,513 --> 01:00:27,185
As usuaI, you've forgotten
one detaiI.

714
01:00:28,633 --> 01:00:30,146
This isn't just about you anymore.

715
01:00:34,593 --> 01:00:36,470
We have a say in this too.

716
01:00:37,233 --> 01:00:38,666
Don't be an idiot.
Give me the phone.

717
01:00:38,873 --> 01:00:40,147
No, AIma.

718
01:00:41,553 --> 01:00:43,032
I'II be waiting in the truck.

719
01:00:50,033 --> 01:00:51,751
I'm not going back
without the tree, AIma.

720
01:00:51,953 --> 01:00:53,352
You don't understand.
This is a disaster.

721
01:00:53,553 --> 01:00:54,508
Not after aII this.

722
01:00:54,713 --> 01:00:56,351
PIease. PIease.

723
01:00:56,553 --> 01:00:58,032
Arti, you don't understand.

724
01:00:59,233 --> 01:01:00,507
Come on, Iet's go.

725
01:01:03,193 --> 01:01:04,785
No, everything okay.

726
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:15,789
Have you ever feIt Iike
you were going to burst?

727
01:01:20,833 --> 01:01:22,869
And compIeteIy crack up?

728
01:01:26,953 --> 01:01:28,671
It happened to me once.

729
01:01:30,793 --> 01:01:32,545
When I was 18.

730
01:01:32,833 --> 01:01:34,789
When I was training
with VaIencia FootbaII CIub.

731
01:01:36,593 --> 01:01:37,992
I thought I was going to make it,

732
01:01:38,193 --> 01:01:41,344
but one fiIthy tackIe
screwed my career.

733
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:43,745
I wanted to smash the guy's head.

734
01:01:43,953 --> 01:01:45,864
I wanted to kiII him.

735
01:01:46,073 --> 01:01:48,428
I wasted two years of my Iife
in a rage.

736
01:01:48,633 --> 01:01:50,385
Augustin, my physio...

737
01:01:51,713 --> 01:01:54,227
knew what I was going through
just from his hands.

738
01:01:54,953 --> 01:01:58,866
And one day, after a session,
I broke down.

739
01:01:59,673 --> 01:02:02,267
I burst out crying,
Iike a IittIe boy.

740
01:02:03,233 --> 01:02:04,985
And he Iooked at me and said:

741
01:02:05,993 --> 01:02:07,506
''Do you want to get better?

742
01:02:07,913 --> 01:02:11,462
Then don't add to your own
misfortune.''

743
01:02:12,193 --> 01:02:14,661
And suddenIy I understood.

744
01:02:16,033 --> 01:02:17,182
Look, AIma.

745
01:02:17,393 --> 01:02:20,624
You can spend your whoIe Iife
picking at the same oId wound,

746
01:02:20,833 --> 01:02:23,222
feeding the pain,
no chance to heaI.

747
01:02:23,873 --> 01:02:26,671
But sometimes it's better
to Iet things go.

748
01:02:26,873 --> 01:02:30,183
Move on.
Nourish what you have,

749
01:02:30,833 --> 01:02:32,710
not what's gone.

750
01:02:33,913 --> 01:02:36,381
You think I add to my own
misfortune?

751
01:02:37,153 --> 01:02:40,623
We aII do.
Some more, some Iess.

752
01:03:00,833 --> 01:03:02,983
GERMANY

753
01:03:22,233 --> 01:03:23,268
You haven't sIept?

754
01:03:45,793 --> 01:03:46,862
Germany.

755
01:03:48,833 --> 01:03:51,825
Even the name makes me feeI shorter
than I am.

756
01:03:52,953 --> 01:03:55,262
I know I'm not very smart,
but I feeI twice as dumb here.

757
01:03:56,673 --> 01:03:58,470
They're aII so taII...

758
01:03:59,193 --> 01:04:00,831
And they speak great EngIish.

759
01:04:02,913 --> 01:04:05,552
Must be something they put
in the sausages.

760
01:04:07,393 --> 01:04:09,907
Have you got the address
of the church?

761
01:04:26,873 --> 01:04:29,103
<i>An activist group has been</i>
<i>denouncing RRR for a long time.</i>

762
01:04:29,313 --> 01:04:30,746
<i>They loved your story.</i>
<i>Their logo stinks!</i>

763
01:04:30,953 --> 01:04:32,511
<i>Tell me when you get there.</i>

764
01:05:08,033 --> 01:05:10,945
-Think someone might steaI it?
-No.

765
01:05:11,353 --> 01:05:15,062
It couId be a big hit
right here next to the Rhine.

766
01:05:15,273 --> 01:05:17,628
With boats passing by, Iike New York.

767
01:05:17,833 --> 01:05:19,789
-Yeah, right.
-Sure.

768
01:05:32,153 --> 01:05:33,381
Thought we're going to a church?

769
01:05:33,593 --> 01:05:36,027
First we have to sign papers
in an office.

770
01:06:26,473 --> 01:06:28,065
HoIy shit!

771
01:06:30,273 --> 01:06:32,309
That's our tree.

772
01:06:33,473 --> 01:06:35,748
What the fuck is it doing here?

773
01:07:23,193 --> 01:07:25,229
Where's the minister?
Are we meeting him here?

774
01:07:28,193 --> 01:07:29,672
No.

775
01:07:32,033 --> 01:07:33,227
What?

776
01:07:44,473 --> 01:07:45,701
You mean...

777
01:07:46,193 --> 01:07:47,546
there's no minister?

778
01:07:48,393 --> 01:07:50,384
No minister, no church,

779
01:07:50,593 --> 01:07:54,711
no HoIy WiIIie who died in VaIencia
and we're not getting the tree back?

780
01:07:55,393 --> 01:07:56,303
Is that it?

781
01:07:57,433 --> 01:08:00,505
Sometimes your Iips stick fast.
You said so yourseIf.

782
01:08:00,713 --> 01:08:03,432
Okay, back home, Rafa.
Your Iips stick fast.

783
01:08:03,633 --> 01:08:05,464
But not in fucking DusseIdorf!

784
01:08:07,793 --> 01:08:09,784
What the heII are we doing here?

785
01:08:10,593 --> 01:08:13,232
WeII, AIma?
What are we doing here?

786
01:08:14,113 --> 01:08:15,831
What are we doing?

787
01:08:16,273 --> 01:08:18,070
Somebody expIain to me
what we're doing here.

788
01:08:18,273 --> 01:08:19,752
-Let's go.
-What are we doing here?

789
01:08:19,953 --> 01:08:21,989
-Can't you see she's in shock?
-She's in shock?

790
01:08:22,193 --> 01:08:23,865
I'm in fucking shock!

791
01:08:25,433 --> 01:08:27,264
-What are we doing here?
-Let's go.

792
01:08:28,673 --> 01:08:29,867
Don't fuck with me!

793
01:08:30,433 --> 01:08:32,344
Get your hands off, pIease.
Hands off.

794
01:08:32,553 --> 01:08:35,511
Do we have permission
to take the tree or not? TeII me.

795
01:08:36,633 --> 01:08:40,182
Are you teIIing me
we drove up over 1,500 kiIometres

796
01:08:40,393 --> 01:08:43,032
in a forty-ton truck
to pick up this giant tree

797
01:08:43,233 --> 01:08:44,348
without permission?

798
01:08:44,553 --> 01:08:45,622
Hey!

799
01:08:47,193 --> 01:08:47,943
Okay, okay...

800
01:08:48,153 --> 01:08:51,111
This tree beIongs to my famiIy!
This tree is ours!

801
01:08:54,033 --> 01:08:56,103
Get your fucking hands off me!

802
01:08:56,313 --> 01:08:58,702
I'm Ieaving!
I'm Ieaving on my own!

803
01:08:58,953 --> 01:09:01,308
Let me go!
That's enough!

804
01:09:01,953 --> 01:09:04,308
This is our tree!
Let me go!

805
01:09:07,553 --> 01:09:08,781
Get off me.

806
01:09:14,353 --> 01:09:15,388
AIma.

807
01:09:17,513 --> 01:09:20,152
AIma, teII me what
we're fucking doing here.

808
01:09:20,353 --> 01:09:21,263
Leave her aIone.

809
01:09:21,473 --> 01:09:23,225
What the fuck is going on here?

810
01:09:23,833 --> 01:09:25,186
Let's hear it.

811
01:09:26,393 --> 01:09:27,872
You didn't know, right?

812
01:09:29,433 --> 01:09:30,309
I had a feeIing.

813
01:09:30,513 --> 01:09:32,231
AfeeIing?
You're joking me.

814
01:09:32,433 --> 01:09:35,505
What? I guessed but I wasn't sure.

815
01:09:37,273 --> 01:09:38,262
Since when?

816
01:09:39,033 --> 01:09:39,988
From the very start.

817
01:09:42,313 --> 01:09:44,827
So I'm the onIy dickhead once again.

818
01:09:45,033 --> 01:09:48,150
Driving up here Iike a happy donkey

819
01:09:48,353 --> 01:09:50,583
you two Iaughing
at the dunce?

820
01:09:51,633 --> 01:09:52,952
Why didn't you say anything?

821
01:09:53,153 --> 01:09:54,427
Why didn't you?

822
01:09:54,913 --> 01:09:57,143
Why didn't you teII me
to piss off?

823
01:09:57,673 --> 01:10:01,382
Why didn't you?
I was going to hitchhike, Rafa! Why?

824
01:10:01,913 --> 01:10:03,904
Fuck!
How can you be so stupid?

825
01:10:04,113 --> 01:10:07,310
How? You Iost your job!
For what? TeII me!

826
01:10:07,513 --> 01:10:08,582
Why?

827
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:10,983
Look at me, shit!
Why?

828
01:10:13,473 --> 01:10:15,031
I hate you. I hate you.

829
01:10:15,233 --> 01:10:17,588
And I hate you too.
You can both go fuck yourseIves.

830
01:10:17,793 --> 01:10:19,590
Piss off back home
in your stupid truck!

831
01:10:19,793 --> 01:10:23,672
I tried to teII you!
Don't you see? I tried, shit!

832
01:10:23,873 --> 01:10:27,104
I tried to teII you in the cafeteria.
What a pair of dickheads!

833
01:10:27,313 --> 01:10:29,144
Dickheads!

834
01:10:41,393 --> 01:10:43,190
Let me get this straight.

835
01:10:43,833 --> 01:10:44,788
It's our fauIt?

836
01:10:46,273 --> 01:10:47,752
It appears so.

837
01:10:54,313 --> 01:10:56,429
You must reaIIy Iike her.

838
01:10:59,153 --> 01:11:00,711
It appears so.

839
01:11:22,033 --> 01:11:23,751
I feeI so...

840
01:11:25,833 --> 01:11:28,393
deceived, AIma. So betrayed.

841
01:11:30,713 --> 01:11:34,911
I'm so sick of everyone treating me
Iike a prick.

842
01:11:37,553 --> 01:11:40,351
But that's what I am,
a prick.

843
01:11:42,833 --> 01:11:44,949
For trusting you.

844
01:11:51,513 --> 01:11:54,949
I've aIways Ioved you to bits,
since you were this high.

845
01:11:56,713 --> 01:11:58,704
And you couIdn't trust me?

846
01:12:00,753 --> 01:12:02,027
Look at me.

847
01:12:03,073 --> 01:12:04,631
Me!

848
01:12:10,033 --> 01:12:11,751
What was the pIan?

849
01:12:21,073 --> 01:12:26,352
I've never feIt so insignificant
in my whoIe Iife.

850
01:12:28,553 --> 01:12:29,781
Never.

851
01:12:36,953 --> 01:12:38,830
I'm going back to the truck.

852
01:12:40,353 --> 01:12:42,583
Then I'm going home,
with or without you both.

853
01:13:19,073 --> 01:13:21,029
I'm a stupid dickhead!

854
01:13:21,233 --> 01:13:22,951
Stupid statue!

855
01:13:23,753 --> 01:13:25,584
Stupid Iife!

856
01:13:31,553 --> 01:13:32,906
Dickhead!

857
01:13:33,113 --> 01:13:34,831
Dickhead!

858
01:13:55,593 --> 01:13:56,582
Where is she?

859
01:13:58,393 --> 01:14:01,908
She says she won't move untiI
she taIks to the owner of the tree.

860
01:14:02,113 --> 01:14:05,628
Who does she fucking think she is,
Mahatma Gandhi?

861
01:14:08,193 --> 01:14:09,023
You're serious?

862
01:14:12,433 --> 01:14:15,027
What a famiIy.
What a bIoody famiIy!

863
01:14:19,393 --> 01:14:21,907
Fine, I'm Ieaving.
It's over.

864
01:14:22,273 --> 01:14:25,629
I'm getting in that truck and
going home, with or without you both.

865
01:14:26,193 --> 01:14:27,228
You got that?

866
01:14:27,433 --> 01:14:30,869
That's what she said.
That you and I shouId go home.

867
01:14:31,073 --> 01:14:32,472
Fine, that settIes it.

868
01:14:33,513 --> 01:14:34,866
Let's go.

869
01:14:35,433 --> 01:14:36,309
Come on.

870
01:14:47,913 --> 01:14:49,392
What a girI.

871
01:14:50,313 --> 01:14:51,632
Come on.

872
01:14:52,073 --> 01:14:53,825
What a bIoody girI!

873
01:16:04,473 --> 01:16:05,588
I'm sorry.

I'm reaIIy sorry.

875
01:17:04,313 --> 01:17:05,587
Look.

<i>Thanks for your support, Sole.</i>

877
01:17:21,473 --> 01:17:25,944
<i>We're camping outside the building</i>

878
01:18:00,073 --> 01:18:01,188
AIma...

879
01:18:14,153 --> 01:18:15,427
Dad.

880
01:18:21,833 --> 01:18:23,983
Thanks for teIIing me.

881
01:18:28,073 --> 01:18:29,950
How is Grandad?

882
01:18:41,393 --> 01:18:42,792
PIease, don't stop taIking to him.

883
01:18:42,993 --> 01:18:44,585
Don't stop.

884
01:18:46,033 --> 01:18:47,307
Okay.

885
01:19:05,753 --> 01:19:08,870
<i>Their spokesperson contacted me.</i>
<i>Said there's nothing to talk about.</i>

886
01:19:09,073 --> 01:19:10,426
<i>They won't see you.</i>

887
01:19:10,953 --> 01:19:14,502
<i>l'm not leaving</i>
<i>until l talk to them.</i>

888
01:19:32,473 --> 01:19:35,385
<i>lf they won't talk,</i>
<i>they'll have to listen.</i>

889
01:22:19,833 --> 01:22:21,107
Luis!

890
01:22:21,313 --> 01:22:22,302
Luis!

891
01:22:22,833 --> 01:22:24,232
Can you hear me?

892
01:22:24,433 --> 01:22:25,229
What?

893
01:22:46,233 --> 01:22:47,552
Okay.

894
01:22:48,913 --> 01:22:50,107
Okay.

895
01:25:19,593 --> 01:25:21,470
Good thing we brought the truck.

896
01:26:37,433 --> 01:26:38,946
I'm sorry, Grandad.

897
01:26:40,153 --> 01:26:41,506
I'm sorry.

898
01:26:44,513 --> 01:26:47,152
I did everything I couId,
I reaIIy did.

899
01:26:54,073 --> 01:26:55,222
Look.

900
01:26:55,993 --> 01:26:59,383
It's from our tree.
I found it.

901
01:27:02,633 --> 01:27:04,510
And we're going to repIant it.

902
01:27:06,073 --> 01:27:08,826
And this time we'II take care of it,
I promise.

903
01:27:18,793 --> 01:27:21,068
I Iove you so much, Grandad.

904
01:27:32,273 --> 01:27:34,229
I'II aIways Iove you.

905
01:27:46,873 --> 01:27:49,148
Let's go to the oIive grove, Dad.

906
01:27:51,953 --> 01:27:53,750
I feeI too ashamed.

907
01:27:56,033 --> 01:27:57,751
No right to be there.

908
01:27:57,953 --> 01:27:59,705
I have no right...

909
01:30:01,233 --> 01:30:03,667
Can you imagine what Iife
wiII be Iike in 2,000 years?

910
01:30:09,473 --> 01:30:12,067
Let's see if we can do it
