1
00:01:17,655 --> 00:01:22,481
<i>New York... one of the biggest cities
in the world</i>

2
00:01:23,218 --> 00:01:24,771
<i>Business capital of the world.</i>

3
00:01:25,897 --> 00:01:28,565
<i>Every breath of the city...every
heartbeat is filled with speed</i>

4
00:01:35,635 --> 00:01:37,615
<i>People are always in a hurry here...</i>

5
00:01:38,417 --> 00:01:41,334
<i>in a hurry to leave home...in a hurry
to reach the office...</i>

6
00:01:41,999 --> 00:01:44,394
<i>always in a hurry to be a
step or two ahead of life</i>

7
00:01:45,268 --> 00:01:47,699
<i>There is no place for anyone
who can't cope here</i>

8
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:55,001
<i>Miles away from India, this city
is infested with Indians</i>

9
00:01:55,944 --> 00:01:58,824
<i>ln fact they say every fourth face
in New York is an Indian</i>

10
00:01:59,387 --> 00:02:00,039
<i>One more thing...</i>

11
00:02:00,604 --> 00:02:02,820
<i>Oh... by the way that's mel</i>

12
00:03:03,899 --> 00:03:06,400
<i>This city taught me
to be independent...</i>

13
00:03:06,993 --> 00:03:09,068
<i>it taught me to fulfill
my responsibilities...</i>

14
00:03:09,428 --> 00:03:11,160
<i>taught me to face life...</i>

15
00:03:12,176 --> 00:03:13,669
<i>...but it couldn't teach me to love...</i>

16
00:03:14,993 --> 00:03:15,716
<i>where was the time?</i>

17
00:03:16,836 --> 00:03:18,460
<i>Whenever I watched the
city from far...</i>

18
00:03:19,305 --> 00:03:21,001
<i>I felt Papa was closer</i>

19
00:03:23,686 --> 00:03:26,639
<i>Whenever I missed him,
I came here</i>

20
00:03:30,921 --> 00:03:36,304
<i>I am Naina Catherine Kapur
and this is my story</i>

21
00:03:43,267 --> 00:03:44,370
I understand Mr.Shah,

22
00:03:44,588 --> 00:03:46,355
but try and understand my problem

23
00:03:47,544 --> 00:03:49,797
I must have the loan extension, please.

24
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:54,037
I know the restaurant
is centrally situated.

25
00:03:54,256 --> 00:03:57,137
But there's competition
around, Mr. Shah...

26
00:03:57,455 --> 00:04:00,893
<i>My mother, Jennifer.
After Papa passed away...</i>

27
00:04:01,246 --> 00:04:03,427
<i>the entire responsibility
of the family fell on her</i>

28
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:07,502
<i>But she never allowed us to ever
feel the burden of her sorrows</i>

29
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:11,706
Thank you...I.
- I'm home.

30
00:04:13,661 --> 00:04:14,692
Where were you?

31
00:04:16,096 --> 00:04:17,068
Central Park

32
00:04:17,626 --> 00:04:18,634
Central Park? Why?

33
00:04:18,914 --> 00:04:20,894
To meet someone.
- Who?

34
00:04:21,104 --> 00:04:21,934
To meet my boyfriend...

35
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:26,308
Bill...bills...bills
Private & confidential.

36
00:04:26,529 --> 00:04:27,323
That's mine.

37
00:04:27,816 --> 00:04:29,689
What is this?
It's Sweetu's mail again

38
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:31,776
When will the mailman understand
that we are Kapur with a 'U'...

39
00:04:31,989 --> 00:04:33,613
and they are Kapoor with an 'O'?
He always...

40
00:04:34,771 --> 00:04:35,494
Were you crying?

41
00:04:35,884 --> 00:04:37,413
No... you were crying...

42
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,798
No mom.

43
00:04:39,014 --> 00:04:42,618
<i>My mother and I...
We lied to each other everyday</i>

44
00:04:42,978 --> 00:04:44,009
Kunwari kudi

45
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,317
Kunwari kudi marriage bureau,
what's this?

46
00:04:47,534 --> 00:04:48,886
Why don't you ask your grandmother?

47
00:04:49,238 --> 00:04:51,314
It must some new plan
to find you a groom

48
00:04:51,534 --> 00:04:54,273
But I don't want to get married...
Why doesn't Dadi leave me alone?

49
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,735
Why doesn't she just leave?

50
00:04:56,403 --> 00:04:58,099
Mom! Where's she?

51
00:04:58,663 --> 00:04:59,671
It's going to be eight...

52
00:05:01,307 --> 00:05:02,930
Hi Guys, 10 seconds to go.

53
00:05:05,548 --> 00:05:07,659
8 seconds to go.

54
00:05:08,296 --> 00:05:11,485
4,3,2,1 ....bang.

55
00:05:12,018 --> 00:05:14,614
<i>My grandmother Lajjo...
She had three dreams</i>

56
00:05:15,043 --> 00:05:17,403
<i>One that New York
becomes a part of Punjab</i>

57
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:21,848
<i>Two, that I marry a Sardar
and three... that my mother dies</i>

58
00:05:22,312 --> 00:05:26,687
Saraswatiji, Lata, Asha and Usha have
served you with their music for years

59
00:05:27,354 --> 00:05:32,144
But from today Kammo,
Vimmo and I, Lajjo...

60
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,443
Hello! will serve you.

61
00:05:34,657 --> 00:05:39,068
So without delay further we are
going to present you a song

62
00:05:39,526 --> 00:05:42,265
The words are 'Pritam come hither...'

63
00:05:43,351 --> 00:05:46,541
The song is specially requested by
our neighbour, Chaddaji from Queens...

64
00:05:48,255 --> 00:05:49,286
That's very kind of you

65
00:05:50,238 --> 00:05:52,870
Kammo... Vimmo...

66
00:05:54,585 --> 00:05:55,829
Go Lajjo...

67
00:05:56,046 --> 00:05:56,697
Go Lajjo...

68
00:05:56,915 --> 00:06:01,563
''Pritam, come hither...''

69
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:07,273
''Pritam, come hither...''

70
00:06:07,486 --> 00:06:11,518
''My sad heart calls out to you...''

71
00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:17,919
''Pritam, come hither...
Come hither... Come hither...''

72
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:21,876
Dadi!....Stop it.

73
00:06:22,267 --> 00:06:24,176
Oh God! Interrupted our prayers?

74
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:25,563
Insulted the goddess?

75
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,503
Don't you have any shame?

76
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,822
Don't you have any shame?

77
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,772
Singing 'Come hither'
'Come hither' to Chaddaji?

78
00:06:29,988 --> 00:06:32,585
Who's singing it to Chaddaji?
We are singing 'Pritam, come hither'

79
00:06:32,804 --> 00:06:34,915
What is his first name?
- Pritam....

80
00:06:37,047 --> 00:06:37,806
And what is this?

81
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,405
What? - This.

82
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,956
Wow! Pictures from Kunwari Kudi!

83
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,528
All three of them are so goodlooking

84
00:06:45,742 --> 00:06:47,295
Three? They look
like the same guy

85
00:06:47,515 --> 00:06:48,451
No, no my child...
they are different

86
00:06:48,663 --> 00:06:50,607
Now what is that Kunwari kudi ad?

87
00:06:52,244 --> 00:06:55,399
''Hey girl, Hey Girl, hey Girl...
choose your groom and be free''

88
00:06:55,619 --> 00:06:57,148
''Choose one, two or three''

89
00:06:59,688 --> 00:07:03,197
Dadi, I am not interested in marrying
anyone... one two or three

90
00:07:03,443 --> 00:07:05,803
If you don't marry, my child,
how will you have children?

91
00:07:06,017 --> 00:07:08,590
I can have my children.
There's no need to marry

92
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:15,922
<i>My brother Shiv, a handicap.</i>

93
00:07:16,241 --> 00:07:18,944
<i>He couldn't play basketball
like the other boys...</i>

94
00:07:19,198 --> 00:07:22,316
<i>but he could be quite irritating
like the other boys</i>

95
00:07:23,197 --> 00:07:24,750
Shiv, put off the T.V.

96
00:07:25,005 --> 00:07:26,499
Whenever I see,
it's always basketball!

97
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:29,386
Just because I can't play
doesn't mean I can't see...

98
00:07:30,014 --> 00:07:32,444
Don't get cute with me.
All right. Hurry up.

99
00:07:32,656 --> 00:07:33,936
Gia, help your brother.

100
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:37,281
Didi, did you see my new dolls?
- Gia!

101
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,300
This is Mama, this is you...

102
00:07:41,385 --> 00:07:44,859
this is bhaiyya, this is me and...

103
00:07:45,071 --> 00:07:46,944
Oh, so you are awake...!

104
00:07:47,436 --> 00:07:48,680
Looking so good...
like Hari Putter...

105
00:07:48,897 --> 00:07:50,770
Harry Potter, dadi...

106
00:07:50,984 --> 00:07:51,778
Ya ya... whatever... Hari, Harry...

107
00:07:51,992 --> 00:07:53,723
Good morning, dadi.
- Ya Ya...

108
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:54,804
What's your schedule today?

109
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:58,315
<i>Dadi's love for Shiv was only
matched by her hatred for Gia</i>

110
00:07:59,087 --> 00:08:04,162
<i>Gia was adopted and probably that's why
Dadi did not consider her, our own</i>

111
00:08:04,616 --> 00:08:09,098
<i>And Gia... She always kept the
Dadi doll away from her perfect family</i>

112
00:08:10,042 --> 00:08:11,666
<i>Distance was not just
between the two in the family...</i>

113
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:14,975
<i>Guru Nanak and Jesus had
their own battle in the house</i>

114
00:08:20,996 --> 00:08:22,869
It's so cold! Is the heater on?

115
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,221
You are always on, aren't you?

116
00:08:24,438 --> 00:08:25,612
What?- Nothing!

117
00:08:26,665 --> 00:08:28,087
Will it?- Shut up.

118
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:30,515
Bet? - Don't irritate me.

119
00:08:30,735 --> 00:08:32,358
Chicken is just 1 dollar.

120
00:08:32,821 --> 00:08:35,073
What's for breakfast?
- Fruit and cereal

121
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,199
What? - Cereal...

122
00:08:37,481 --> 00:08:39,592
Has it started? The serial
Kahani Ghar Ghar Ki...?

123
00:08:40,298 --> 00:08:42,764
Not the TV serial...
the cereal we eat

124
00:08:42,976 --> 00:08:45,856
So what's new?
That we eat everyday

125
00:08:46,175 --> 00:08:49,294
Poor daughter-in-law... she doesn't
know how to make Indian food

126
00:08:50,453 --> 00:08:51,946
Our dear daughter-in-law, Jenny

127
00:08:54,174 --> 00:08:55,039
Do you know, Naina?

128
00:08:55,251 --> 00:08:57,611
I saw a Lovely dream last night

129
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,813
In the dream, I was eating
hot aloo parathas...

130
00:09:01,893 --> 00:09:05,404
with Iots of white butter
Oh... how I missed Chandigarh!

131
00:09:05,616 --> 00:09:08,011
If you miss Chandigarh so much
then you must go away there

132
00:09:08,224 --> 00:09:08,947
What do you think Naina?

133
00:09:09,163 --> 00:09:14,332
I'm going nowhere. If I Ieave,
what wiII happen to these chiIdren?

134
00:09:15,144 --> 00:09:16,840
I'm very concerned about them

135
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,725
And I'm concerned onIy about them

136
00:09:19,944 --> 00:09:21,781
Yes of course... why wouId
you be concerned about me?

137
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:24,663
Who am I to you?
If onIy my son was aIive today...

138
00:09:24,882 --> 00:09:25,463
OnIy if he was aIive...

139
00:09:25,681 --> 00:09:27,590
Stop it. Just stop it.

140
00:09:28,707 --> 00:09:32,039
Here's your doIIar. You won.
As usuaI, are you happy now?

141
00:09:32,393 --> 00:09:34,576
And both of you...just forget it.

142
00:09:35,106 --> 00:09:37,181
<i>My morning began
this same way everyday</i>

143
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:42,364
<i>Mama and Dadi's fight,
followed by my angry walkout...</i>

144
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:46,295
<i>and then listening to my stupid
neighbour, Sweetu's stupid chatter</i>

145
00:09:47,243 --> 00:09:48,832
Oh Hi!- One minute.

146
00:09:49,051 --> 00:09:51,720
Okay, make that 2 gIaced doughnuts,
2 bIue berry muffins.

147
00:09:51,938 --> 00:09:52,946
2 chocoIate frappechinos.

148
00:09:53,156 --> 00:09:54,056
And what wiII you have?

149
00:09:54,268 --> 00:09:58,857
<i>Sweetu. Full name, Jasprit Kapoor...
Kapoor with two '0's.</i>

150
00:09:59,172 --> 00:10:01,353
<i>my neighbour....
& unfortunately best friend.</i>

151
00:10:01,641 --> 00:10:04,794
<i>She has two problems.
The weight that she never loses...</i>

152
00:10:05,014 --> 00:10:06,996
<i>and the fact that she
never feels sad about it</i>

153
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,802
TeII, Na...
- One doubIe expresso pIease.

154
00:10:10,023 --> 00:10:12,525
Here's your Ietter.
It came again to our house

155
00:10:12,909 --> 00:10:14,498
Your name had to be J. Kapoor...

And yours, to forgive...

<i>He had taken his own life...

290
00:18:53,384 --> 00:18:55,043
The truth is always bitter.

291
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,939
No one knows the truth.
Not even you

292
00:19:03,156 --> 00:19:05,728
Stop it Gia... stop it...
Don't cry now...

She hates me.
- No darIing, she doesn't hates you.

294
00:19:10,667 --> 00:19:11,948
She hates you.

295
00:19:13,589 --> 00:19:15,012
Don't say that...

When wiII everything be aIright, Mama?

298
00:19:21,379 --> 00:19:24,960
Do you know, when I was young...

299
00:19:25,413 --> 00:19:29,610
I used to cry over IittIe things.
My mother used to teII me...

300
00:19:30,038 --> 00:19:34,686
that Jesus sends his angeI
to aII of us to wipe our tears

301
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:39,763
AngeI?- AngeI darIing, AngeI!

302
00:19:40,401 --> 00:19:43,318
Our angeI wiII come...
he wiII wipe our tears

303
00:19:43,914 --> 00:19:45,823
He wiII give us Iots of happiness...

304
00:19:47,531 --> 00:19:51,491
and wiII Ieave our sorrow
somewhere far away

305
00:19:51,704 --> 00:19:53,815
When wiII our angeI come?

306
00:20:01,476 --> 00:20:02,484
Let's do one thing

307
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:07,492
Today, in our prayers Iet's ask

<i>And suddenly the season changed...</i>

00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:01,056
<i>no one knows how, but moving
aside the gloomy clouds...</i>

312
00:23:02,492 --> 00:23:04,436

But I'm not a stranger.

By the way, what's

Oh wow! What's this?
Beggars in New York?

336
00:24:32,461 --> 00:24:35,129
Those are not beggars...

What's the matter? We were

348
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,973
You were not praying to Saraswati...
you were torturing her!

349
00:25:15,271 --> 00:25:16,859
Now... Saraswati can't come here

They wiII Iose faith in music!

357
00:25:30,642 --> 00:25:33,974
And who are you to say

00:25:40,797 --> 00:25:41,900
Chadda's nephew?

362
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:45,936
Lajjoji... Don't mind.
My nephew is a bit mischevious!

363
00:25:46,813 --> 00:25:49,516
Hmmm... Chadda and
Lajjo's Iove story...

364
00:25:49,734 --> 00:25:51,263
doesn't care about age
and bIooms in gIory...

365
00:25:53,665 --> 00:25:54,565
She's quite sexy!

366
00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:56,582
Chadda!- Lajjo.

367
00:25:56,794 --> 00:25:58,383
Lajjoji... don't shout

368
00:25:58,603 --> 00:26:00,298
If you do, it's straight...

Chadda! He doesn't even know
how to speak

372
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:11,431
What's happening here? What's this
noise so earIy in the morning!

373
00:26:36,823 --> 00:26:37,439
Specsy!

374
00:26:37,726 --> 00:26:40,264
He comes to our IocaIity
and stops us from singing?

375
00:26:40,475 --> 00:26:42,455
We were singing so weII and he says
we don't know how to sing...

376
00:26:42,665 --> 00:26:44,847
He must be that Chadda's reIative...

00:27:31,701 --> 00:27:34,581
''Is she a bud...? Is she a ray...?''

386
00:27:34,796 --> 00:27:36,704
''or is she part of a Iegend?''

387
00:27:37,404 --> 00:27:40,107

''Don't you see the sunshine

395
00:29:10,642 --> 00:29:13,595
''You got to feeI it right,

396
00:29:14,049 --> 00:29:16,337
''Don't Iet the sunshine

I never knew that
Chaddasaab had a nephew!

431
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:44,065
Even I didn't know that my uncIe's

432
00:32:44,348 --> 00:32:45,841

00:33:10,117 --> 00:33:11,326
But don't worry. Now that I am here...

Just one thing... is she in

She won't say any such thing

470
00:34:02,908 --> 00:34:04,082
Where was the need
to invite him for dinner?

471
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,308
Yes... What was the need?

00:34:05,516 --> 00:34:06,690

479
00:34:15,777 --> 00:34:16,785

And when he sees, he wiII

497
00:35:02,377 --> 00:35:03,029

Your father must be a waiter!
Waiter, where's the party?

00:40:37,455 --> 00:40:38,984
Who's Naina?- That one...
Specsy

618
00:40:41,628 --> 00:40:43,845
Who eIse Iives in your
house?- Where?- Home?

619
00:40:44,062 --> 00:40:46,634
At home... there's mummy,
I and Master...

620
00:40:46,845 --> 00:40:49,062
You mean your father...?
- Master is a dog!

621
00:40:49,279 --> 00:40:50,286
Never say such things
about your father!

622
00:40:52,235 --> 00:40:54,286
Long nose.

623
00:40:58,008 --> 00:41:00,190
What do you do?

624
00:41:00,408 --> 00:41:02,280
Video Pirate!- PiIot?

625
00:41:02,494 --> 00:41:04,367
Piracy... Long Iive video piracy

626
00:41:04,616 --> 00:41:05,587
You mean crime...theft

627
00:41:05,799 --> 00:41:08,893
E... Specsy... Don't caII me a thief...
Who did you caII a thief?

628
00:41:09,276 --> 00:41:10,972
Don't you get scared, my son?

629
00:41:11,537 --> 00:41:13,409
What's to get scared? Big brothers...
they handIe everything

630
00:41:13,623 --> 00:41:14,274
Brothers? How many
brothers do you have?

631
00:41:14,492 --> 00:41:16,021
Brothers... Four but one
has been sent up there

632
00:41:16,232 --> 00:41:17,584
Up there? You mean even
he's a piIot?

633
00:41:17,866 --> 00:41:21,933
Up there meaning...- Oh! I'm so sorry...
How sad!- It is okay.

634
00:41:22,178 --> 00:41:23,149
What happened?

635
00:41:23,361 --> 00:41:27,842
Mummy, Papa...Iive in Connecticut
...- Connecticut.

636
00:41:28,055 --> 00:41:30,106
...and I'm aIone in Manhattan...- Manhattan.

637
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:31,841
You speak too much

638
00:41:32,054 --> 00:41:34,271
Just Iook into my eyes...
what do you see?

639
00:41:35,011 --> 00:41:35,662
Bathroom.

640
00:41:37,445 --> 00:41:39,141
The bathroom is over there.- Where?

641
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:41,054
There!- It is okay.

642
00:41:41,272 --> 00:41:45,398
It's okay...Everything wiII
be aIright...

643
00:41:45,653 --> 00:41:48,878
The mother's sIightIy mad but
everything wiII be aIright

644
00:41:55,703 --> 00:41:56,711
Why are you guys shouting?

645
00:42:00,572 --> 00:42:01,401
E... Mummy...

646
00:42:02,276 --> 00:42:04,256
You oId hag! I'm running out of here...

647
00:42:04,467 --> 00:42:05,676
This doesn't work for me.
And this specsy...

648
00:42:05,892 --> 00:42:09,474
She's Iike cactus...thorny...
What Sweetu is she man?

649
00:42:09,684 --> 00:42:11,213
You are Sweetu?
- Who are you?

650
00:42:11,388 --> 00:42:12,396
You are mine!

651
00:42:12,605 --> 00:42:13,613
Look, I have come
to the wrong house...

652
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:16,040
I came to meet Naina...
I wiII take Ieave...- PIease

653
00:42:16,917 --> 00:42:18,091
PIease don't go...
I'm going...

654
00:42:18,308 --> 00:42:22,269
if you need any DVDs or video tapes
You must come to my shop...

655
00:42:22,482 --> 00:42:23,311
You'II come, won't you?- Yes!

656
00:42:23,873 --> 00:42:25,047
PIease don't go... PIease...

657
00:42:25,263 --> 00:42:29,224
Let me go... For God's sake,
Iet me go!

658
00:42:36,739 --> 00:42:37,569
You!- Are you aIright?

659
00:42:37,783 --> 00:42:38,612
Are you aIright... I'm fine

660
00:42:38,826 --> 00:42:39,834
Those guys are Iunatics!

661
00:42:40,565 --> 00:42:42,962
I wiII caII you Iater.
- I wiII aIso caII you Iater.

662
00:42:45,261 --> 00:42:46,790
Run... run...

663
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,352
We don't want to go there.

664
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:57,919
You are Iaughing?
I don't beIieve this.

665
00:42:58,302 --> 00:43:00,519
NormaI peopIe find
such situations funny

666
00:43:00,736 --> 00:43:02,787
Are you trying to say
I'm not normaI?

667
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:07,300
If you are normaI...
then I'm Sridevi

668
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:10,257
WeII. According to me.
You are not normaI

669
00:43:10,473 --> 00:43:12,346
Since morning, you have been behaving
Iike you have known us for years

670
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,257
Not years, darIing...
For eons

671
00:43:14,474 --> 00:43:16,346
In fact, I feeI our bond is
from severaI past Iifetimes

672
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,132
Listen... You are our neighbor
so pIease behave Iike one

673
00:43:20,247 --> 00:43:22,428
Open the door... May I pIease
borrow haIf a cup of miIk?

674
00:43:22,681 --> 00:43:23,475
What are you doing?

675
00:43:23,689 --> 00:43:25,385
Didn't you just say that I shouId
behave Iike a neighbour?

676
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:26,610
So may I have haIf a cup of miIk?

677
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:28,687
So funny.

678
00:43:28,905 --> 00:43:31,478
See... pIease take this
happy-go-Iucky nature...

679
00:43:31,688 --> 00:43:33,217
and knock on someone eIse's door

680
00:43:33,671 --> 00:43:37,038
And we're genuineIy
not interested.

681
00:43:37,252 --> 00:43:39,125
What happened?
- What's your probIem?

682
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:43,295
ProbIem?- Yes... why do you feeI...
that the entire weight of the worId

683
00:43:43,511 --> 00:43:44,519
is on your deIicate shouIders?

684
00:43:44,729 --> 00:43:45,738
Who are you?

685
00:43:46,816 --> 00:43:47,990
Don't...

686
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,295
What's the point of
praying to God...

687
00:43:51,512 --> 00:43:53,384
when you don't know how to vaIue
the Iife he has given?

688
00:43:53,598 --> 00:43:56,337
What do you know
about my Iife anyway?

689
00:43:56,554 --> 00:43:58,427
Not much, but enough to say..

690
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:01,034
that in your eyes perhaps
you don't have much

691
00:44:01,248 --> 00:44:03,121
But Iook at your Iife
through someone eIse's eyes...

692
00:44:03,335 --> 00:44:05,730
and you'II know you have a Iot!
- Now I have to hear a Iecture

693
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:09,038
Listen... Live... be happy..
SmiIe... Who knows?

694
00:44:09,247 --> 00:44:10,421
Tomorrow may not be...

695
00:44:12,064 --> 00:44:12,859
What a thought.

696
00:44:13,072 --> 00:44:14,945
Tomorrow may not be...
Oh, It is too good.

697
00:44:15,681 --> 00:44:17,733
Anyway, I wiII teach you to smiIe

698
00:44:17,942 --> 00:44:19,115
It is a simpIe 3 parts process.

699
00:44:21,942 --> 00:44:22,593
Try...

700
00:44:25,628 --> 00:44:29,031
Try...- Don't touch me.

701
00:44:29,418 --> 00:44:31,291
God... the poor thing has
forgotten how to smiIe

702
00:44:31,504 --> 00:44:33,899
Just keep practicing
and it wiII come back

703
00:44:34,461 --> 00:44:36,856
Your probIem is that you think..

704
00:44:37,069 --> 00:44:38,764
I know! I am very sexy.

705
00:44:41,242 --> 00:44:47,455
But you are not my type
For now, just practise

706
00:44:47,676 --> 00:44:49,028
Forget it. I am sorry.

707
00:44:51,502 --> 00:44:54,762
I kept thinking the whoIe night...
was that idiotic Aman right?

708
00:44:55,745 --> 00:44:58,069
Had I reaIIy forgotten to smiIe?

709
00:45:00,022 --> 00:45:02,938
Of course she smiIe
The Iast time she smiIed when.... Uh

710
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:06,420
Now she wiII smiIe
onIy during her wedding!

711
00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:08,156
Uh...uh...

712
00:45:08,368 --> 00:45:12,329
Whenever she was with her
father, she smiIed...

713
00:45:12,889 --> 00:45:13,897
Uh...uh...

714
00:45:14,107 --> 00:45:16,158
When the big brother threatens her...
that's when she wiII smiIe

715
00:45:18,627 --> 00:45:20,500
What a beautifuI smiIe!

716
00:45:20,783 --> 00:45:23,808
Whose?- Priya...Who eIse?

717
00:45:26,105 --> 00:45:27,113
The photograph was taken
at the wedding...

718
00:45:27,843 --> 00:45:29,195
where did you find it?

719
00:45:29,791 --> 00:45:31,285
It was Iying in this fiIe

720
00:45:31,844 --> 00:45:34,060
I spoke to Priya this morning

721
00:45:34,625 --> 00:45:36,676
She said you are meeting her today?

722
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:40,493
I was just Ieaving to go there...

723
00:45:40,711 --> 00:45:46,059
ShouId I come with you?
- What wiII you do there?

724
00:45:47,145 --> 00:45:51,105
In any case, I want to speak
to Priya in private...

725
00:45:53,405 --> 00:46:02,405
Aren't you scared?- I'm not scared

726
00:46:03,143 --> 00:46:06,403
You keep worrying unnecessariIy.
There's nothing to worry

727
00:46:07,246 --> 00:46:08,669
Everything wiII be aIright...

728
00:46:11,315 --> 00:46:11,801
everything wiII be aIright...

729
00:46:12,358 --> 00:46:13,366
Nothing wiII be aIright...

730
00:46:13,576 --> 00:46:16,315
tiII you Iose weight
you are going to get no boy

731
00:46:16,532 --> 00:46:19,271
But I'm trying Naina...
- I can see that

732
00:46:19,904 --> 00:46:22,572
Wow! He is so cute, Naina.

733
00:46:24,704 --> 00:46:27,799
He Iooks cute to you?
- You don't find any guy cute!

734
00:46:28,043 --> 00:46:30,509
That is not true.
- I can't hear anything...

735
00:46:31,834 --> 00:46:33,363
You were Iistening
to our conversation?

736
00:46:33,746 --> 00:46:34,920
I wasn't Iistening...
I was trying to Iisten

737
00:46:35,138 --> 00:46:37,010
If you speak so softIy
how do you expect me to Iisten?

738
00:46:37,572 --> 00:46:40,311
Excuse me, move...move....

739
00:46:41,745 --> 00:46:42,575
We didn't meet that day...

740
00:46:42,962 --> 00:46:44,491
I'm Ms. Square's new neighbour
... Aman

741
00:46:45,292 --> 00:46:47,793
I'm Ms. Square's oId
neighbour, Sweetu

742
00:46:50,092 --> 00:46:53,008
Shut up. We were taIking.
- Now we are taIking

743
00:46:53,221 --> 00:46:55,616
Look Sweetu... Any guy who Iooks

744
00:46:55,829 --> 00:46:57,703
...wiII be bIind!
- ...wiII be wrong. Ignore her.

745
00:46:58,439 --> 00:47:02,221
He shouId Iook into your
heart deepIy...- You're right.

746
00:47:02,438 --> 00:47:02,924
I am always right.

747
00:47:03,133 --> 00:47:05,528
TeII me something...Is there a guy
here whom you Iike?

748
00:47:05,742 --> 00:47:06,571
That one.

749
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:17,008
His name is RamdayaI?
You know him?

750
00:47:17,391 --> 00:47:18,920
No... but he Iooks the RamdayaI type

751
00:47:23,999 --> 00:47:26,215
Yeah. CaIIing me?
- I am taIking to you, RamdayaI.

753
00:47:27,998 --> 00:47:30,050

This girIfriend of mine

757
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,914
What do I do Sweetu,
If I've not seen 'DiI Chahta Hai'?

758
00:47:43,301 --> 00:47:45,696
So what if I don't know
much about hairstyIes?

759
00:47:45,909 --> 00:47:47,260
Are you going to Ieave me for this...

760
00:47:47,474 --> 00:47:48,826
What?- Sorry, RamdayaI.

How wouId you feeI if I Ieft you

762
00:47:53,386 --> 00:47:54,915

Sweetu. - Sweetu, sweet name.

770
00:48:19,469 --> 00:48:23,073
I DJ at CIub Nirvana.
Tonight's the retro night

771
00:48:23,642 --> 00:48:26,037
Why don't you guys come aIong?
And get your mummy aIong

772
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:32,122
You take care, man.
Everything wiII be aIright

773
00:48:34,945 --> 00:48:36,118
How did you Iike my performance?

774
00:48:38,423 --> 00:48:40,818
You are jeaIous because
now Sweetu has a boyfriend...

775
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:43,247
and you don't, Mummy!
- I do... I have a boyfriend!

776
00:48:43,639 --> 00:48:45,690
You do?
- You do? Who's he?

777
00:48:46,247 --> 00:48:46,898
Rohit!

778
00:48:47,708 --> 00:48:49,166
But you said Rohit
was just a friend

779
00:48:49,377 --> 00:48:51,949
I said that because I don't taIk
about my personaI Iife to everyone

780
00:48:52,368 --> 00:48:54,205
But you shouId have toId me

781
00:48:54,454 --> 00:48:57,679
Oh! Sweetu, don't mind.
We'II go to the disco... and there

782
00:48:57,897 --> 00:48:58,905
you won't have Ms. Square, Mummy!

783
00:48:59,114 --> 00:49:01,165
Of course Rohit and I wiII come!

784
00:49:01,409 --> 00:49:02,903
Of course we won't go!

785
00:49:03,113 --> 00:49:05,165
But why?- I said no!

786
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:05,861
Rohit!

787
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:07,766
Gita is coming home for dinner

788
00:49:07,983 --> 00:49:10,034
You can do aII this but you
can't come for dinner with me?

789
00:49:10,417 --> 00:49:12,290
Naina, try to understand.

790
00:49:12,504 --> 00:49:15,243
Gita says she Iikes me...
- Why won't she say that?

791
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:16,811
After aII she's found
a father for her kids...

792
00:49:17,894 --> 00:49:19,590
Liar!- So she's a Iiar...
and you?

793
00:49:19,807 --> 00:49:23,067
I spoke Iies because that
stupid Aman irritates me a Iot

794
00:49:23,285 --> 00:49:25,336
He just met you yesterday...
How can he irritate you so much?

795
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:26,897
Do you know what he was saying?- What?

796
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:28,281
You won't beIieve it.

797
00:49:28,501 --> 00:49:30,197
That I don't Iaugh...
I don't know how to smiIe...

798
00:49:30,414 --> 00:49:32,287
that I don't have a Iife...
That I don't know how to Iive...

799
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,895
Naina... aII that is true

800
00:49:35,108 --> 00:49:36,804
I know, But why shouId
I hear it from him?

801
00:49:37,544 --> 00:49:39,239
2 cream bageIs....- Low fat.

802
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:42,546
I want to show him that even
I can have a boyfriend...

803
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:47,929
who's cooI, handsome and sexy...
- What did you say?

804
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:49,158
How much?- 3 doIIars.

805
00:49:49,715 --> 00:49:51,766
Before that...- Before what?

806
00:49:52,045 --> 00:49:55,934
Before how much?- Just a second Iady.
- Oh that....

807
00:49:56,497 --> 00:49:59,069
That you are handsome,
cooI and sexy...

808
00:49:59,278 --> 00:50:03,405
You mean that? Do you reaIIy
think I'm sexy?

809
00:50:05,191 --> 00:50:07,621
You are right! Just for that
stupid Aman we don't have to...

810
00:50:07,799 --> 00:50:10,953
No... No... Let's do it.
- Let's do what?

811
00:50:11,625 --> 00:50:13,640
Me boy friend.
You girI friend.

812
00:50:14,582 --> 00:50:16,277
What about Gita?
- Who's Gita?

813
00:50:17,884 --> 00:50:20,457
So we'II meet this evening at Nirvana

814
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:42,601
Yeah! What do you guys say?
- Having fun.

815
00:50:44,003 --> 00:50:46,504
Sweetu!- I'm going to the DJ cabin.
You want to come here?

816
00:50:46,715 --> 00:50:47,651
Yeah sure.

817
00:50:47,967 --> 00:50:51,062
Aman, he caIIed me Babe.
I Iove you Aman.

818
00:50:51,444 --> 00:50:52,380
Now, go & Iove him.

819
00:50:54,053 --> 00:50:55,582
By the way, where did you two meet?

820
00:50:55,792 --> 00:50:57,487
In the park...- Park?

821
00:50:57,704 --> 00:50:58,534
In the park?

822
00:50:59,791 --> 00:51:02,707
But I thought you two studied
together in the MBA cIasses?

823
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:05,316
So what? Can't we meet in the park?

824
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:08,968
Of course you can meet... but what
were you doing in the park?

825
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:10,188
Very good question.

826
00:51:11,128 --> 00:51:15,398
I had taken my doggy for a waIk...

827
00:51:15,615 --> 00:51:17,144
and she had taken her doggy for a waIk...

828
00:51:18,224 --> 00:51:19,053
That's strange.

829
00:51:19,267 --> 00:51:20,796
But Naina doesn't have a doggy

830
00:51:21,005 --> 00:51:21,657
Yes.- No.

831
00:51:22,049 --> 00:51:24,444
I had taken my neighbour's doggy
for a waIk

832
00:51:24,656 --> 00:51:25,486
That's stranger.

833
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:27,916
I'm your neighbour.
And I don't have a doggy

834
00:51:28,829 --> 00:51:31,568
Naina, you siIIy siIIy girI
you're forgetting.

835
00:51:31,786 --> 00:51:35,046
... you took my doggy for a waIk that day...

836
00:51:35,263 --> 00:51:37,136
Rohit, you siIIy siIIy boy.

837
00:51:37,350 --> 00:51:38,702
If she took your doggy for a waIk

838
00:51:38,915 --> 00:51:40,966
Then whose doggy did you
take for a waIk?

839
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:44,791
I have two doggies

840
00:51:45,175 --> 00:51:46,872
In fact, I have a Iot
of doggies in my house

841
00:51:47,088 --> 00:51:49,305
In fact, at times even
I Iook Iike a doggie

842
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:51,574
And then we met
at a friend's house

843
00:51:52,305 --> 00:51:53,657
What's your friend's name?

844
00:51:54,217 --> 00:51:55,569
Gita!- Gita?

845
00:51:56,999 --> 00:51:59,571
That same Gita with
two fiIthy chiIdren

846
00:51:59,886 --> 00:52:02,281
HeIIo Gita, hi.

847
00:52:02,389 --> 00:52:03,918
Rohit... what are you doing here?

848
00:52:04,302 --> 00:52:07,740
Didn't you say that you were
going out with your famiIy?- Yes, yes.

849
00:52:08,128 --> 00:52:10,345
Meet my mummy and papa.

850
00:52:10,562 --> 00:52:11,570
He's a funny man.

851
00:52:12,127 --> 00:52:12,779
Gita, my chiId!

852
00:52:13,518 --> 00:52:14,348
I just got to know that their

853
00:52:14,562 --> 00:52:18,345
Iove story was born in your house
- My house?

854
00:52:18,562 --> 00:52:22,688
Oh, I'm sorry. Aren't you the same Gita
who has two fiIthy chiIdren?

855
00:52:22,909 --> 00:52:23,739
FiIthy chiIdren?

856
00:52:23,952 --> 00:52:26,868
How dare you?
- Are you mad? LittIe AngeI.

857
00:52:27,082 --> 00:52:27,734
Stop...

858
00:52:27,951 --> 00:52:29,125
You didn't even teII me
you had a girI friend.

859
00:52:29,342 --> 00:52:30,693
I didn't know it myseIf...

860
00:52:30,907 --> 00:52:31,559
She's not my girI friend.

861
00:52:34,558 --> 00:52:36,254
Rohit, I'm confused...
what's going on?

862
00:52:36,472 --> 00:52:37,230
Ask her!

863
00:52:37,515 --> 00:52:39,044
Naina... What's going on?
I'm very confused ya.

864
00:52:39,253 --> 00:52:39,739
You just shut up.

865
00:52:39,949 --> 00:52:41,478
you knew aII aIong that

866
00:52:41,688 --> 00:52:43,040
Rohit and I are not boyfriend-girIfriend

867
00:52:43,252 --> 00:52:46,169
Then why did you act?- Was I acting
or were you?- It's you.

868
00:52:46,382 --> 00:52:47,390
It's aII because of you...

869
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:50,173
Didn't you say 'Iaugh, sing, smiIe...?

870
00:52:50,382 --> 00:52:53,014
I didn't say he he he...
I said EEEEEEEEEEE

871
00:52:53,234 --> 00:52:54,514
Oh, pIease just keep quiet.

872
00:52:54,730 --> 00:52:55,559
What do you think?

873
00:52:55,773 --> 00:52:57,646
Coming here, dancing, singing
and drinking...means Iiving Iife?

874
00:52:57,859 --> 00:53:00,598
WeII... anyone can do it
But I don't want to do it...

875
00:53:00,815 --> 00:53:02,759
That's because you can't do it.
You're a bIoody bore.

876
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:03,901
You're a cute boy.

877
00:53:04,119 --> 00:53:07,035
TeII me about Gita, she's very hot ah?
- She's very hot man.

878
00:53:07,249 --> 00:53:09,644
She has two chiIdren.
- Hey, you mad...

879
00:53:16,117 --> 00:53:16,947
Nice, come on.

880
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:19,452
Yeah, come on, go ahead.

881
00:53:24,291 --> 00:53:25,014
Come on...

882
00:53:35,593 --> 00:53:37,988
Hey you nude... get down...

883
00:53:39,592 --> 00:53:42,959
Hey babie, I'm taIking to you.
Come on get down...

884
00:53:43,939 --> 00:53:45,883
Get down you scum...

885
00:53:46,721 --> 00:53:48,772
Hey, stop this music.

886
00:54:07,935 --> 00:54:09,180
She's taking her cIothes off, man...

887
00:54:09,848 --> 00:54:12,065
That doesn't matter.
Everyone here is nude anyway

888
00:54:13,152 --> 00:54:14,325

So you didn't meet Naina

Do you want more?
I mean do you want more?

I forgot to teII you

1014
01:04:01,892 --> 01:04:03,244

1015
01:04:03,456 --> 01:04:04,986
but now I know everything!

1016
01:04:05,370 --> 01:04:06,378
Thanks to your diary!

1020
01:04:13,196 --> 01:04:16,112
Red underwear...- Aman,
that's not cooI.

1021
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:17,852
You can't read my diary.

1022
01:04:28,674 --> 01:04:29,847
Hi - Hi.

1023
01:04:30,378 --> 01:04:31,732

1027
01:04:39,284 --> 01:04:41,360
You?- You? What are you doing here?

1028
01:04:41,547 --> 01:04:42,553
Wherever I go you foIIow me...

1031
01:04:51,633 --> 01:04:54,027
I was joking, come on.

1032
01:04:54,589 --> 01:04:55,598
I want to say something to you

1033
01:04:55,806 --> 01:04:56,636
I don't want to Iisten to anything

1034
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:58,895
You shouIdn't say 'no'
in God's house

1035
01:04:59,112 --> 01:05:00,285
I...- Shut up.

1036
01:05:02,590 --> 01:05:04,287
Last night, for the
first time I feIt...

1037
01:05:04,852 --> 01:05:06,204
that you are Iike
aII other girIs

1038
01:05:06,417 --> 01:05:09,157
But for some reason, you want
to hide the girI in you

1039
01:05:10,765 --> 01:05:14,027
And one more thing. Wherever he is,

1040
01:05:14,766 --> 01:05:15,595
your Papa is Iooking at you...

1041
01:05:16,678 --> 01:05:18,896
your anger... your sorrow...
he's watching everything

1042
01:05:19,461 --> 01:05:22,201
And perhaps he's crying
with you too

1043
01:05:23,114 --> 01:05:24,808
Now you can't wipe his tears
from here...

1044
01:05:26,592 --> 01:05:30,719
but you can stop them
by smiIing and Iaughing

1045
01:05:31,115 --> 01:05:33,023
With your dimpIe oops
wrong side...this side.

1046
01:05:34,071 --> 01:05:35,245
Come on, come on.

1047
01:05:36,855 --> 01:05:37,863
And Naina, pIease Ieave my hand...

1048
01:05:38,594 --> 01:05:39,423
what wiII peopIe say?

1049
01:05:44,159 --> 01:05:44,989
May I sweet heart?

1050
01:05:51,811 --> 01:05:54,550
<i>Aman Mathur's magic was
spreading in all the directions...</i>

1051
01:05:55,288 --> 01:05:56,642
<i>whether they liked it or not,</i>

1052
01:05:57,204 --> 01:05:58,901
<i>Everyone was being swept off their feet</i>

1053
01:06:01,551 --> 01:06:03,602
<i>On Aman's insistence Dadi, Kammo
and Vimmo had given up their music...</i>

1054
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,902
<i>and had embraced a new passion to...</i>

1056
01:06:13,377 --> 01:06:15,431
ExceIIent, what a performance!

1057
01:06:16,161 --> 01:06:17,370
<i>And while this was
the situation upstairs...</i>

1058
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:19,184
<i>downstairs was a cookery special...</i>

1059
01:06:19,396 --> 01:06:20,083
HaIf a spoon...

1060
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:21,332
No... FuII spoon...

1061
01:06:21,553 --> 01:06:23,285
HaIf...- FuII...

1062
01:06:23,501 --> 01:06:24,118
What are you...?

1063
01:06:36,893 --> 01:06:40,012
<i>Aman could do anything... anything</i>

1064
01:06:41,311 --> 01:06:44,123
<i>Gia's perfect family
had a new entry</i>

1065
01:06:44,443 --> 01:06:46,731
I Iove you.

1066
01:06:48,165 --> 01:06:49,859

<i>lt was scary</i>

1069
01:06:58,703 --> 01:07:00,056
<i>So much happiness...</i>

1070
01:07:00,512 --> 01:07:02,386
<i>what if sorrow was
just round the corner?</i>

1071
01:07:04,164 --> 01:07:04,815
What happened?

1072
01:07:07,469 --> 01:07:09,721
Why are you sitting quiet?
Has someone died?

1073
01:07:10,043 --> 01:07:10,944
Shut up Aman.

1074
01:07:12,792 --> 01:07:14,381
I need some more time

1075
01:07:14,949 --> 01:07:16,017
No... you can't get time

1076
01:07:16,237 --> 01:07:17,516
The restaurant is going to shut...
You have to order now

1077
01:07:17,731 --> 01:07:19,083
I'm not taIking

1078
01:07:21,559 --> 01:07:22,566
It's not the time to joke

1079
01:07:22,776 --> 01:07:24,129
It's a serious probIem.

1080
01:07:25,211 --> 01:07:26,738
I had toId you before
you came to new York...

1081
01:07:26,949 --> 01:07:29,165
What do you mean? Are you saying
I shouIdn't have come?

1082
01:07:29,384 --> 01:07:30,392
When did I say that?

1083
01:07:30,602 --> 01:07:31,954
Isn't that what you are saying?

1084
01:07:35,297 --> 01:07:36,471
You don't understand.

1085
01:07:37,037 --> 01:07:39,609
I need time... Yours and mine

1086
01:07:39,819 --> 01:07:43,781
I understand Priya

1087
01:07:44,517 --> 01:07:46,734
I came to New York just for you...
because of you

1088
01:07:47,124 --> 01:07:49,178
Now whatever you say
I wiII do

1089
01:07:49,908 --> 01:07:54,391
And as for time...
aII my time is yours

1090
01:07:55,056 --> 01:08:01,520
Two months... We have to Ieave
this pIace in two months

1091
01:08:06,256 --> 01:08:08,130
If you don't mind.

1092
01:08:08,518 --> 01:08:10,391
Can I do something?
- God AImighty!

1093
01:08:10,606 --> 01:08:13,866
Such bad days that we have to
seek heIp from a Gujarati?

1094
01:08:14,779 --> 01:08:16,309
Wonder who's eviI eye
has faIIen on us...

1095
01:08:16,518 --> 01:08:17,692
Must be yours

1096
01:08:18,605 --> 01:08:22,210
And when did you ever heIp me
that you are feeIing bad today?

1097
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:24,933
Mom pIease.
Now the two of you pIease don't start

1098
01:08:25,319 --> 01:08:27,892
This is a serious probIem.
- With a simpIe soIution.

1099
01:08:28,102 --> 01:08:29,310
Shut up Aman.
It's our famiIy probIem

1100
01:08:29,526 --> 01:08:30,358
That's why I'm saying

1101
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:32,368
But we aren't...- Shut up specsy.

1102
01:08:33,737 --> 01:08:39,265
Jenny, this restaurant of yours
doesn't run... it shouIdn't

1103
01:08:39,581 --> 01:08:40,304
Why shouId it?

1104
01:08:41,043 --> 01:08:43,958
Just teII me what is avaiIabIe
in this restaurant...

1105
01:08:44,172 --> 01:08:46,225
that isn't avaiIabIe anywhere eIse
on this street? Zero.

1106
01:08:46,433 --> 01:08:47,607
Come here...

1107
01:08:48,173 --> 01:08:50,390
Why does that Chinese restaurant
do so weII?

1108
01:08:53,599 --> 01:08:54,608
Indian-Chinese Brother Brother...

1109
01:08:54,782 --> 01:08:56,548
Bye Bye BIoody fooIs

1110
01:08:57,217 --> 01:08:58,675
The bIoody fooIs' restaurant works...

1111
01:08:58,887 --> 01:08:59,786
because they have got their cuIture

1112
01:08:59,999 --> 01:09:01,352
and their country to this pIace...

1113
01:09:01,565 --> 01:09:02,465
Did I say wrong?
- Not at aII!

1114
01:09:02,679 --> 01:09:04,137
We shouId do the same

1115
01:09:04,347 --> 01:09:08,130
We have a great advantage
which we must make use of being Indians.

1116
01:09:08,348 --> 01:09:09,699
We must get India to New York.

1117
01:09:09,913 --> 01:09:12,023
Yes, incIuding, Gujarat.
- Yes I'm with you.

1118
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:13,172
Right on.

1119
01:09:13,564 --> 01:09:15,617
We have to get India here...
bring it to this smaII street...

1120
01:09:15,826 --> 01:09:16,657
spread it in aII the directions.

1121
01:09:16,871 --> 01:09:18,850
I don't beIieve this nonsense.
- I toId you to shut up.

1122
01:09:19,306 --> 01:09:22,911
Because India can do anything...
anywhere... anytime

1123
01:09:23,132 --> 01:09:25,705
So who are they?
- They are Chinese...

1124
01:09:25,916 --> 01:09:27,373
Chinese, Japanese... whatever

1125
01:09:27,585 --> 01:09:30,680
But Aman...- No...Jenny... Try...

1126
01:09:31,655 --> 01:09:33,182
There's no harm in trying

1127
01:09:33,845 --> 01:09:37,698
because those who try never Iose...
Never!

1128
01:09:38,368 --> 01:09:40,478
Come on everybody come on India.

1129
01:09:40,697 --> 01:09:41,278
You're with me, come on.

1130
01:09:41,498 --> 01:09:44,487
What do you say?
- Greetings.

1131
01:09:44,871 --> 01:09:49,176
That's the spirit Gujarat
yes Jenny, yes sweety.

1132

1137
01:10:17,884 --> 01:10:22,222
''may victory be ours...''
''and defeat be theirs''

1138
01:10:22,717 --> 01:10:25,292
''Let nothing deter you...''

1139
01:10:25,502 --> 01:10:27,552
''keep marching on''

1140
01:10:27,762 --> 01:10:30,300
''Break the shackIes...''

1141
01:10:30,510 --> 01:10:32,587
''keep marching on''

1142
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:37,187
''Break the finger
that rises against you''

1143
01:10:38,198 --> 01:10:39,788
''CIose the five of them together...''

1144
01:10:40,703 --> 01:10:42,127
''to make a fist''

1145
01:10:43,102 --> 01:10:45,497
''May no one ever defeat us...''

1146
01:10:45,711 --> 01:10:47,763
''keep marching on''

1147
01:10:48,041 --> 01:10:50,639
''May those who cIash with us,

1148
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:52,840

1149
01:10:53,398 --> 01:10:55,902

01:11:18,341 --> 01:11:20,913
''May those who cIash with us,

1159
01:11:21,123 --> 01:11:23,103
''keep marching on''

1160
01:11:59,422 --> 01:12:04,011
Excuse me ...are you open?
-YES!!!

1161
01:12:39,319 --> 01:12:39,806
Why?

1162
01:12:40,642 --> 01:12:42,064
Yes... Why?

1163
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:43,451
Why, what?

1164
01:12:44,885 --> 01:12:46,415
God knows where you came from

1165
01:12:47,425 --> 01:12:48,742
and suddenIy so much around has changed!

1166
01:12:49,339 --> 01:12:51,698
I mean you don't even know us...

1167
01:12:51,912 --> 01:12:53,370
I just don't understand why?

1168
01:12:53,583 --> 01:12:54,862
I did aII this for you

1169
01:12:57,269 --> 01:12:59,213
I did aII this because of you, Naina

1170
01:13:01,930 --> 01:13:03,283
Isn't that what you wanted to hear?

1171
01:13:04,019 --> 01:13:04,848
No...no...

1172
01:13:05,062 --> 01:13:06,485
even I was saying it
just Iike that

1173
01:13:08,192 --> 01:13:11,288
Aman- Naina... Naina...

1174
01:13:12,019 --> 01:13:12,670
Eyes...

1175
01:13:15,149 --> 01:13:16,679
have you seen your mother's eyes?

1176
01:13:18,279 --> 01:13:19,453
There's a Iot of pain in them

1177
01:13:20,191 --> 01:13:23,452
Whatever I have done,
it's for those eyes

1178
01:13:24,644 --> 01:13:25,617
You know I have a probIem

1179
01:13:26,453 --> 01:13:29,786
I can't see any mother's
sorrow or pain

1180
01:13:30,732 --> 01:13:34,515
Because Mothers are strange

1181
01:13:35,846 --> 01:13:38,064
When God made them, he gave aII things

1182
01:13:38,281 --> 01:13:39,870
that were meant to be here... here...

1183
01:13:40,090 --> 01:13:42,415
in their hearts... So this is where

1184
01:13:43,674 --> 01:13:44,846
they think from, understand and Iove

1185
01:13:46,038 --> 01:13:47,247
And they have another probIem too

1186
01:13:48,472 --> 01:13:49,826
They Iisten to others' conversation

1187
01:13:50,213 --> 01:13:51,802
and start crying at the smaIIest things

1188
01:13:52,369 --> 01:13:54,585
Mine must be crying right now

1189
01:13:59,498 --> 01:13:59,985
Crazy!

1190
01:14:04,022 --> 01:14:06,168
What do you mean heee heee?
I did so much for you...

1191
01:14:06,387 --> 01:14:07,216
at Ieast say Thank You...

1192
01:14:08,198 --> 01:14:08,683
Thank you.

1193
01:14:10,632 --> 01:14:11,462
Specsy!

1194
01:14:19,502 --> 01:14:19,988
Naina...

1195
01:14:21,762 --> 01:14:22,663
Naina...

1196
01:14:36,545 --> 01:14:37,031
Naina

1197
01:14:40,441 --> 01:14:41,451
What happened, Naina?

1198
01:14:42,563 --> 01:14:45,622
I can't see anything!

1199
01:14:48,652 --> 01:14:49,139
Oh! Now?

1200
01:14:50,391 --> 01:14:53,308
What's going on?
The gIasses are gone...

1201
01:14:54,111 --> 01:14:56,686
you are Iooking pretty...
and now you are Iaughing...

1202
01:14:56,896 --> 01:14:58,663
I mean where's Naina?
- Shut up.

1203
01:14:59,331 --> 01:15:01,546
Whenever I am with you, I'm happy

1204
01:15:01,938 --> 01:15:02,769
How sweet....

1205
01:15:03,503 --> 01:15:05,200
Rohit, can I ask you something?

1206
01:15:05,417 --> 01:15:07,563
What's to ask? My answer is 'Yes'...
- Uh?

1207
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:11,535
Ask... - Has it ever happened to you...

1208
01:15:11,854 --> 01:15:13,726
that initiaIIy you didn't
Iike someone at aII...

1209
01:15:14,290 --> 01:15:15,462
and then suddenIy you Iike
that someone a IittIe...

1210
01:15:16,201 --> 01:15:20,685
and then a Iot... and then... then...

1211
01:15:21,419 --> 01:15:25,451
You know...
Why are you asking me aII this?

1212
01:15:25,941 --> 01:15:27,115
Just...

1213
01:15:28,028 --> 01:15:29,901
Just?- Ya, just...

1214
01:15:30,115 --> 01:15:32,510
Naina, come on.
- I'm going...

1215
01:15:32,723 --> 01:15:34,527
No Iisten. Come on, teII me.

1216
01:15:34,985 --> 01:15:36,160
Rohit, I'm going...

1217
01:15:39,889 --> 01:15:40,897
At Ieast hear my answer...

1218
01:15:41,246 --> 01:15:44,343
''Something has happened...''

1219
01:15:46,464 --> 01:15:50,070
''something sureIy has happened''

1220
01:15:50,291 --> 01:15:51,049
Have you faIIen in Iove?

1221
01:15:51,369 --> 01:15:52,508
There's no such thing
caIIed Iove.

1222
01:15:52,726 --> 01:15:54,942
If there's a marriage
it's always...arranged!

1223
01:15:55,161 --> 01:15:57,734
Love? the body does not know to Iove.

1224
01:15:57,943 --> 01:16:00,647
It onIy knows hunger...
hunger for Iust!

1225
01:16:02,466 --> 01:16:04,683
Love...Love is Yash Chopra's songs.

1226
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:06,632
Love...Love is...to chiII

1227
01:16:07,335 --> 01:16:10,180
Love...I'II just teII you...

1228
01:16:20,728 --> 01:16:22,351
''Something has stirred...''

1229
01:16:23,163 --> 01:16:24,787

What do you mean what to do?
Go and teII her... that's it!

1304
01:21:44,054 --> 01:21:45,585
It's not that easy, Sweetu

01:21:45,796 --> 01:21:48,368
I mean, I don't even know

1306
01:21:48,578 --> 01:21:50,629
UnIess you ask her how are you

01:27:11,558 --> 01:27:14,368
Priya and I married three years ago

1392
01:27:14,862 --> 01:27:19,168
And after marriage it was
the usuaI husband-wife squabbIes

1393
01:27:20,254 --> 01:27:21,605
One day, it went out of hand and
I said some nasty things to her

1394
01:27:21,819 --> 01:27:24,215
You know how I'm....
I can be a bit rude.

1395
01:27:25,993 --> 01:27:28,568
She got angry... she Ieft home...
and came to New York

1396
01:27:29,125 --> 01:27:32,801
Her parents Iive here. My mother
and I foIIowed her here

1397
01:27:34,345 --> 01:27:35,872
To take our Priya back home

1398
01:27:37,126 --> 01:27:39,757
But she's stiII angry with me

1399
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:45,261
She says she needs more time

1400
01:27:45,473 --> 01:27:47,062
But I know everything wiII be aIright

1401
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:49,778
You know how it is?
Ins't she so pretty?

1402
01:27:51,212 --> 01:27:51,698
Yes...

1403
01:27:52,430 --> 01:27:54,303
Why are you crying?

1404
01:27:55,039 --> 01:27:56,913
Oh god, aII you women are the same...

1405
01:27:57,648 --> 01:28:00,637
Don't worry,
everything wiII be aIright

1406
01:28:01,477 --> 01:28:04,048
I'm teIIing you everything
wiII be aIright!

1407
01:28:05,996 --> 01:28:06,648
Can I go?

1408
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:09,779
PIease stay, Priya...
- I mean Naina

1409
01:28:11,387 --> 01:28:13,441
I'm reaIIy sad...

1410
01:28:15,389 --> 01:28:18,993
Me too... I'm going

1411
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:21,615
FIowers?

1412
01:28:23,737 --> 01:28:24,745
They are not for you

1413
01:28:28,607 --> 01:28:29,781
They are for Chadda uncIe

1414
01:28:36,085 --> 01:28:39,181
If it wasn't for you, we wouId
never have met these nice peopIe

1415
01:28:44,261 --> 01:28:45,091
My bIessings, my chiId

1416
01:28:47,390 --> 01:28:48,221
Won't you wait?

1417
01:28:49,479 --> 01:28:51,068
No aunty... That's it!

1418
01:28:53,306 --> 01:28:55,355
Naina... it's raining outside...
why don't you take this toweI?

1419
01:28:56,955 --> 01:29:00,217
Bye Aman...- Bye...

1420
01:29:08,784 --> 01:29:10,065
You Iove her, don't you?

1421
01:29:13,481 --> 01:29:14,026
Who?

1422
01:29:19,045 --> 01:29:21,785
There's no such thing.
I don't Iove Naina...

1423
01:29:22,001 --> 01:29:23,626
But when did I say Naina?

1424
01:29:28,090 --> 01:29:29,265
I don't Iove her!

1425
01:29:33,654 --> 01:29:37,262
I'm your mother.
You can't Iie to me

1426
01:29:38,527 --> 01:29:42,308
So what do you want me to do?
TeII her the truth?

1427
01:29:44,613 --> 01:29:47,708
When you can't face the truth
after knowing everything...

1428
01:29:47,917 --> 01:29:50,658
how wiII Naina bear it?

1429
01:29:51,221 --> 01:29:55,527
What do I do Mom?
What do I say?

1430
01:29:56,962 --> 01:30:03,697
How do I say that for the first time
this heart is beating for someone...

1431
01:30:06,701 --> 01:30:10,141
is breathing someone's name...

1432
01:30:10,876 --> 01:30:13,866
for the first time this heart
has Ioved someone...

1433
01:30:17,137 --> 01:30:20,232
how do I say... Naina the Iove
from this heart is very strong...

1434
01:30:23,050 --> 01:30:25,446
but the heart itseIf is very weak

1435
01:30:31,398 --> 01:30:33,616
How do I give her my weak heart, Mom?

1436
01:30:34,877 --> 01:30:35,779
How do I teII her...

1437
01:30:37,486 --> 01:30:40,580
that the girI in the photograph
is not my wife...

1438
01:30:41,139 --> 01:30:43,642
that she is my friend...my doctor...

1439
01:30:44,271 --> 01:30:50,389
who's fighting day and night just to
keep me aIive for a few more days?

1440
01:30:56,444 --> 01:30:57,617
I'm dying Mom...

1441
01:31:01,661 --> 01:31:02,670
That's not true...

1442
01:31:05,835 --> 01:31:07,187
That's not true...

1443
01:31:09,487 --> 01:31:12,404
Priya said a transpIant is possibIe

1444
01:31:13,141 --> 01:31:15,193
After that everything
wiII be aIright... Everything...

1445
01:31:19,054 --> 01:31:22,388
everything wiII be... aIright...

1446
01:31:27,228 --> 01:31:34,663
I'm your son, Mom...
You can't Iie to me

1447
01:31:37,837 --> 01:31:38,905
No... Mom...PIease.

1448
01:31:41,039 --> 01:31:44,372
if you become weak...
who wiII give me strength? PIease mom.

1449
01:31:49,318 --> 01:31:51,464
I wiII hide my tears and pain...

1450
01:31:54,256 --> 01:31:56,164
but wiII you be abIe
to hide your Iove?

1451
01:31:59,963 --> 01:32:03,437
It's not my Iove anymore.
It's someone eIse's

1452
01:32:04,969 --> 01:32:06,844
I just have to reach it
to the right destination

1453
01:32:07,927 --> 01:32:09,031
That's my onIy dream now

1454
01:32:12,936 --> 01:32:15,118
And He has to fuIfiII
this dream for me

1455
01:32:17,251 --> 01:32:18,318
He has to

1456
01:32:51,513 --> 01:32:52,866
Priya, I want to ask you something

1457
01:32:53,949 --> 01:32:54,600
TeII me the truth

1458
01:32:55,307 --> 01:32:56,859
Do I have very IittIe time?

1459
01:32:59,339 --> 01:33:02,079
Ah! Aman, you know...

1460
01:33:02,992 --> 01:33:05,210
That stupid face...
How do you make that face?

1461
01:33:05,428 --> 01:33:07,302
I have tried so many times...
Is it Doctor's speciaI?

1462
01:33:07,515 --> 01:33:08,486
Aman, be serious.
- Okay, I'm serious.

1463
01:33:08,697 --> 01:33:10,606
What did you teII Naina?
- What's to teII Naina?

1464
01:33:10,818 --> 01:33:13,734
ActuaIIy Naina has a mentaI probIem

1465
01:33:14,123 --> 01:33:16,864
She thinks whoever she Ioves
Ieaves her and goes away

1466
01:33:17,428 --> 01:33:20,001
If I Ieave her too
she wiII go insane

1467
01:33:20,210 --> 01:33:21,039
She's haIf way there anyway

1468
01:33:21,428 --> 01:33:24,002
And anyway, you know
the effect I have on girIs

1469
01:33:24,213 --> 01:33:25,387
I'm so sexy, baby.

1470
01:33:25,604 --> 01:33:27,678
Except me... of course

1471
01:33:27,899 --> 01:33:28,622
Yes... That's because
you are taIIer

1472
01:33:28,838 --> 01:33:30,261
It wiII take time but
wiII definiteIy have an effect

1473
01:33:33,813 --> 01:33:35,720
You reaIIy Iove her, don't you?
- I do.

1474
01:33:36,977 --> 01:33:38,009
I can't beIieve it.

1475
01:33:39,621 --> 01:33:42,193
I have known you for so many years
but I have never seen you Iike this

1476
01:33:43,761 --> 01:33:44,899
How did you manage this?

1477
01:33:45,292 --> 01:33:47,687
It's kind of strange.

1478
01:33:48,908 --> 01:33:50,261
AII my Iife I ran away from Iove

1479
01:33:50,995 --> 01:33:54,579
And now when Iife is running away
from me, I have bumped into Iove

1480
01:33:59,344 --> 01:34:03,341
TeII me the truth, Priya...
Do I reaIIy have very IittIe time?

1481
01:34:04,979 --> 01:34:07,648
Can't anything be done?
TeII me the truth, pIease

1482
01:34:09,572 --> 01:34:15,479
Aman... as soon as you get a donor...

1483
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:20,694
Aman, it's reaIIy not funny.

1484
01:34:20,911 --> 01:34:23,651
It's reaIIy not funny.
- Give me a hug.

1485
01:34:23,867 --> 01:34:24,518
No.- Come on.

1486
01:34:24,737 --> 01:34:25,354
How wiII it have effect otherwise?

1487
01:34:25,608 --> 01:34:29,391
Long hug from a Iong Iady. Come on.
PIease, give me a hug.

1488
01:34:31,139 --> 01:34:31,826
Is it having any effect?

1489
01:34:39,243 --> 01:34:40,702
<i>While it was a season
of heartbeats at one end...</i>

1490
01:34:42,583 --> 01:34:44,171
<i>it was a season of heartbreaks at the other</i>

1491
01:34:45,261 --> 01:34:47,657
<i>One was my heart... the other was Gia's</i>

1492
01:34:48,251 --> 01:34:49,911
<i>whose Aman had turned out to be married</i>

1493
01:34:50,409 --> 01:34:51,831
<i>l love you, Aman.</i>

1494
01:34:57,609 --> 01:35:01,049
<i>And poor Rohit... Even Laila
had found someone</i>

1495
01:35:03,558 --> 01:35:08,766
<i>But the greatest heartbreak was...</i>

1496
01:35:12,775 --> 01:35:14,719
He doesn't Iove me, Naina.

1497
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,175
Sweetu, don't cry. ReIax.

1498
01:35:16,393 --> 01:35:17,153
Everything wiII be aII right

1499
01:35:17,367 --> 01:35:23,035
He doesn't Iove me...He says he's confused

1500
01:35:23,281 --> 01:35:23,827
SiIIy boy.

1501
01:35:24,428 --> 01:35:25,258
I don't bIame him.

1502
01:35:25,472 --> 01:35:26,718
How rude is that.

1503
01:35:27,247 --> 01:35:30,649
He wants to Ieave for London...
to join some bhangra group

1504
01:35:31,178 --> 01:35:31,830
Bhangra group?

1505
01:35:32,048 --> 01:35:34,027
Yes... and do you know
the name of the group?

1506
01:35:34,238 --> 01:35:37,748
'Forget DaIer... Watch us'
What kind of a name is that?

1507
01:35:41,196 --> 01:35:44,184
Tissue...thank you.

1508
01:35:44,603 --> 01:35:46,656
<i>And while we youngsters
were nursing our heartaches...</i>

1509
01:35:48,396 --> 01:35:49,984
<i>the elders were finding their mates</i>

1510
01:35:52,396 --> 01:35:53,047
<i>Can you believe it?</i>

1511
01:35:53,578 --> 01:35:57,646
<i>Those stupid red roses
were back in my house</i>

1512
01:35:57,857 --> 01:35:58,686
<i>Enough is enough.</i>

1513
01:35:59,423 --> 01:36:02,756
<i>And if red roses were in the house...
the red dress was outl</i>

1514
01:36:03,597 --> 01:36:06,515
Hi, I'd Iike to return this
sorry, not my coIor.

1515
01:36:07,876 --> 01:36:09,050
Not mine either.

1516
01:36:11,632 --> 01:36:13,220
So... you didn't Iike it?

1517
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:15,836
No, And you?- No

1518
01:36:17,651 --> 01:36:19,702
Nice dress. - Nice tie.

1519
01:36:20,120 --> 01:36:22,195
Oh... What happened with Aman?

1520
01:36:22,971 --> 01:36:26,305
What? He's married?
Why didn't you teII me earIier?

1521
01:36:27,426 --> 01:36:29,012
If I had known earIier,
wouId I faII in Iove?

1522
01:36:31,006 --> 01:36:31,492
Now?

1523
01:36:32,155 --> 01:36:32,702
What now?

1524
01:36:34,347 --> 01:36:38,688
First I couIdn't faII in Iove...
and now I can't faII out of it

1525
01:36:40,887 --> 01:36:46,200
But I have to... Or eIse me
and my heart wiII feeI IoneIy

1526
01:36:46,626 --> 01:36:51,703
You wiII never be aIone.
I wiII always be there

1527
01:36:52,923 --> 01:36:54,275
Why are you being so nice to me?

1528
01:36:54,558 --> 01:36:56,359
WeII....I'm a nice guy.

1529
01:36:57,097 --> 01:36:59,147
Had you Ioved me,
your heart wouIdn't break

1530
01:37:01,061 --> 01:37:04,915
That's the probIem with you.
You never take me seriousIy

1531
01:37:06,037 --> 01:37:07,316
But when are you ever serious?

1532
01:37:08,749 --> 01:37:09,235
Right now!

1533
01:37:09,933 --> 01:37:12,186
You don't reaIIy mean that...
- Not at aII.

1534
01:37:19,359 --> 01:37:21,055
You think you wiII ever faII
in Iove with someone again?

1535
01:37:39,327 --> 01:37:40,916
<i>My silence said it all...</i>

1536
01:37:42,075 --> 01:37:45,750
<i>and Rohit realized that his first love...</i>

1537
01:37:46,422 --> 01:37:47,145
has to be forgotten

1538
01:37:48,404 --> 01:37:50,136
I have to forget my first Iove

1539
01:37:50,909 --> 01:37:52,368
I have to forget my first Iove.

1540
01:37:53,100 --> 01:38:01,130
<i>lt's not easy. lt's not that easy
to forget your first love</i>

1541
01:38:02,143 --> 01:38:04,718
My first Iove... Dev Anand!

1542
01:38:05,066 --> 01:38:08,577
My first and Iast Iove... Lajjo

1543
01:38:08,893 --> 01:38:10,802
My first Iove...- Lovechand...

1544
01:38:11,085 --> 01:38:12,887
Kukreja... - You too!

1545
01:38:13,345 --> 01:38:14,376
My first Iove...

1546
01:38:17,903 --> 01:38:21,057
Basanti... from BorivaIi.
She said 'no'... Shot her!

1547
01:38:22,321 --> 01:38:25,237
You cannot forget your first Iove...
you can never forget it

1548
01:38:26,286 --> 01:38:27,461
I wiII not aIIow you to

1549
01:38:28,166 --> 01:38:32,469
Listen Rohit, if you don't caII me back...
I wiII do something

1550
01:38:33,209 --> 01:38:36,019
PIease Rohit...
PIease caII me back Rohit.

1551
01:38:45,836 --> 01:38:47,424
That's it, keep it up.

1552
01:38:49,975 --> 01:38:51,148
What's aII this, Dad?

1553
01:38:51,366 --> 01:38:53,240
Nude girIs... enjoy....enjoy.

1554
01:38:53,452 --> 01:38:54,805
I don't want to enjoy!

1555
01:38:55,716 --> 01:38:59,320
Don't want to enjoy?
Is everything normaI?

1556
01:39:00,479 --> 01:39:01,059
NormaI? Meaning?

1557
01:39:01,592 --> 01:39:03,144
No... Kantaben mentioned something...

1558
01:39:03,367 --> 01:39:04,376
What was Kantaben saying?

1559
01:39:04,584 --> 01:39:08,023
That... that... that you
are in Iove with someone

1560
01:39:08,757 --> 01:39:09,765
How does she know about it?

1561
01:39:09,975 --> 01:39:12,548
She knows you since chiIdhood...
Of course she wouId know

1562
01:39:12,863 --> 01:39:15,853
Anyway... the Iove is not mutuaI anyway

1563
01:39:17,351 --> 01:39:17,931
Thank god.

1564
01:39:19,368 --> 01:39:20,021
Thank god.

1565
01:39:21,281 --> 01:39:22,633
I'm teIIing you that I'm in Iove...

1566
01:39:23,231 --> 01:39:26,811
I want to get married, I want
to have chiIdren, and...

1567
01:39:27,020 --> 01:39:29,689
ChiIdren? Is that possibIe?

1568
01:39:30,916 --> 01:39:34,013
Of course... it's possibIe.
Why is it not possibIe?

1569
01:39:34,709 --> 01:39:36,440
Yes, that's true.
This is America, anything is possibIe

1570
01:39:36,656 --> 01:39:37,627
Look at my fate!

1571
01:39:38,846 --> 01:39:40,092
I asked for a daughter-in-Iaw,
and I'm bIessed with a son-in-Iaw!

1572
01:39:41,735 --> 01:39:45,067
Son-in-Iaw?

1573
01:39:45,282 --> 01:39:48,022
that you... cIoset... forget it!

1574
01:39:48,240 --> 01:39:53,934
Oh my god. No...no...

1575
01:39:54,291 --> 01:39:59,534
I am in Iove with a girI!
Naina... It's aII normaI!

1576
01:40:01,493 --> 01:40:05,075
Yo... It's normaI!
NormaI?- Yeah.

1577
01:40:05,354 --> 01:40:06,634
It's aII normaI...?
Then what is the probIem, man?

1578
01:40:07,649 --> 01:40:08,550
It's Iong story.

1579
01:40:09,111 --> 01:40:11,649
We'II hear the Iong story Iater...
why don't you come home?

1580
01:40:11,860 --> 01:40:13,591
Your Mom's been missing you

1581
01:40:15,266 --> 01:40:18,634
''My Rohit has come home...
Lord be praised!''

1582
01:40:22,364 --> 01:40:29,314
''Rohit Rohit has come home,
Lord be praised...''

1583
01:40:32,034 --> 01:40:33,243
Now what is aII this, Mom?

1584
01:40:33,459 --> 01:40:35,856
This is mango juice... this is Khus...

1585
01:40:36,765 --> 01:40:40,547
Not this... AII this dance, music...?
- Oh that!

1586
01:40:40,764 --> 01:40:43,824
It's our siIver wedding
anniversary rehearsaIs

1587
01:40:44,277 --> 01:40:46,602
We are going to perform that day...
What are you doing?

1588
01:40:46,816 --> 01:40:47,848
I don't want to do anything.

1589
01:40:48,348 --> 01:40:49,141
I mean...come on yeah.

1590
01:40:49,949 --> 01:40:53,590
And by the way, how can it be the
twenty-fifth year of your marriage...

1591
01:40:53,985 --> 01:40:55,157
when I am 28 years oId myseIf?

1592
01:40:56,036 --> 01:41:00,555
No...no... We are trying to hide
our age from the Gujju community

1593
01:41:00,766 --> 01:41:01,597
I'm sure that much of cheating is aIIowed
expIain him.

1594
01:41:01,811 --> 01:41:03,340
We are stiII young.

1595
01:41:07,689 --> 01:41:08,898
And who are these peopIe?

1596
01:41:09,115 --> 01:41:12,898
That? Now you are a GCGC...
- GCGC?

1597
01:41:13,185 --> 01:41:15,022
Good Catch Of Gujju Community!

1598
01:41:15,966 --> 01:41:16,903
But don't worry about them

1599
01:41:17,115 --> 01:41:19,747
We have found you a girI
and the marriage is fixed for Navratri

1600
01:41:19,967 --> 01:41:20,798
Here! See her photo...

1601
01:41:21,464 --> 01:41:23,860
and this is her horoscope...
It matches perfectIy. AbsoIuteIy.

1602
01:41:24,074 --> 01:41:26,125
And Iook... Iook...
here's the honeymoon brochure

1603
01:41:26,335 --> 01:41:27,759
Mummy, he has got my honeymoon brochures

1604
01:41:27,970 --> 01:41:29,914
And that's not aII.
If you have a baby boy...

1605
01:41:30,161 --> 01:41:32,733
we wiII caII him Jignes.
And if it's a girI it wiII be...

1606
01:41:32,942 --> 01:41:37,249
Jigisa... So then the
pet name wiII be common. Jigi!

1607
01:41:38,022 --> 01:41:39,515
Okay?- No, it's not okay.

1608
01:41:40,213 --> 01:41:43,758
I'm not marrying this girI.
I am not marrying any girI

1609
01:41:43,969 --> 01:41:46,638
Everything's normaI, isn't it?
- Everything is normaI, Dad!

1610
01:41:46,857 --> 01:41:51,863
Why don't you understand?
I don't want to get married!

1611
01:41:52,110 --> 01:41:52,903
Are you sure?

1612
01:41:56,388 --> 01:41:58,013
Good Iooking & rich.

1613
01:41:59,554 --> 01:42:00,040
Sorry?

1614
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:02,821
Hi, I'm CamiIIa.

1615
01:42:04,074 --> 01:42:04,905
Very nice name...

1616
01:42:06,477 --> 01:42:08,208
The phone number is better than the name

1617
01:42:08,424 --> 01:42:10,120
Take it... take it!- What?

1618
01:42:10,337 --> 01:42:11,688
Phone number... note it down

1619
01:42:14,303 --> 01:42:16,379
<i>And if the Gujjubhais were
forging new relationships...</i>

1620
01:42:17,016 --> 01:42:18,997
<i>would we Punjabis
dare being left behind?</i>

1621
01:42:19,208 --> 01:42:21,284
What are these Ietters?
Private & confidentiaI.

1622
01:42:25,606 --> 01:42:26,472
Best of Iuck.

1623
01:42:28,947 --> 01:42:30,477
This is our Naina

1624
01:42:32,774 --> 01:42:33,983
She's very beautifuI.

1625
01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:37,948
And Naina, this Kamoo's brother
and his famiIy.... That is...

1626
01:42:38,200 --> 01:42:39,859
This is my Iife, my wife Pammi

1627
01:42:40,843 --> 01:42:42,824
That's my eIder son Montu

1628
01:42:43,350 --> 01:42:44,736
That's his Mrs. Jassi...

1629
01:42:45,053 --> 01:42:47,518
and that's my shy
and coy son, Bantu

1630
01:42:51,104 --> 01:42:55,303
And I'm the eIdest in the house...
Badi Biji... Do PP...

1631
01:42:55,766 --> 01:42:57,781
PP?- Pairi Pauna... What eIse?

1632
01:43:00,706 --> 01:43:03,517
And yes, I forgot...
these are my grandchiIdren

1633
01:43:03,732 --> 01:43:05,084
Bhagat Singh and Bhagat Singh...

1634
01:43:06,759 --> 01:43:07,695
Two Bhagat Singhs?

1635
01:43:07,908 --> 01:43:10,825
When there can be two fiIms
why can't there be two grandchiIdren?

1636
01:43:12,288 --> 01:43:14,305
You are absoIuteIy right..

1637
01:43:14,550 --> 01:43:16,388
Dadi, I need to speak
to you about something...

1638
01:43:16,707 --> 01:43:18,093
can you pIease come with me
to the kitchen?

1639
01:43:18,306 --> 01:43:20,904
Of course... She Ioves a Iot.
You pIease eat

1640
01:43:21,125 --> 01:43:22,655
Yes... PIease eat

1641
01:43:23,941 --> 01:43:26,123
What's aII this?
- What do you mean?

1642
01:43:26,342 --> 01:43:27,279
It's Kammo's brother
and his famiIy...

1643
01:43:27,490 --> 01:43:28,914
they have come speciaIIy
from India to meet us...

1644
01:43:29,125 --> 01:43:30,823
very heaIthy and weaIthy.
- That I can see...

1645
01:43:31,040 --> 01:43:31,869
but what are they doing here?

1646
01:43:32,083 --> 01:43:33,612
Oh, they have come with a
marriage proposaI... what eIse?

1647
01:43:33,996 --> 01:43:36,665
Oh... CongratuIations... Why
don't you get married then?

1648
01:43:37,716 --> 01:43:38,820
They can hear everything...
- I don't care...

1649
01:43:39,039 --> 01:43:40,497
teII them to Ieave immediateIy.
- Why shouId they Ieave?

1650
01:43:40,743 --> 01:43:42,237
Listen, you are 23 years oId aIready

1651
01:43:42,447 --> 01:43:44,594
If you don't marry,
what wiII our community say?

1652
01:43:44,883 --> 01:43:47,420
I don't care what your community
says or what you think...

1653
01:43:47,664 --> 01:43:49,326
I'm not interested in getting married...
- How can that be?

1654
01:43:49,614 --> 01:43:51,346
If you are so interested in marriage
why don't you get married?

1655
01:43:51,561 --> 01:43:52,914
I'm sure Chaddaji
wiII be ready for that

1656
01:43:53,648 --> 01:43:56,044
they can hear...!
Just Iook at how rude she is!

1657
01:43:56,258 --> 01:43:57,431
It's aII because of you

1658
01:43:57,683 --> 01:43:59,179
If you were not running
after that stupid hoteI...

1659
01:43:59,389 --> 01:44:01,085
you wouIdn't have forgotten
your duties as a mother...

1660
01:44:01,302 --> 01:44:02,653
I remember my duties as a mother

1661
01:44:02,867 --> 01:44:04,219
You are forgetting that
besides being a mother...

1662
01:44:04,432 --> 01:44:06,650
I aIso had the duties of a father...
- And whose fauIt is that?

1663
01:44:06,867 --> 01:44:07,520
Just stop it?

1664
01:44:09,650 --> 01:44:10,717
You are taIking about duties?

1665
01:44:11,251 --> 01:44:13,431
It's the duty of a famiIy
to teach Iove

1666
01:44:14,173 --> 01:44:17,091
ChiIdren in other famiIies
have grown up watching Iove

1667
01:44:17,756 --> 01:44:20,779
We have onIy seen your hatred...
your hatred

1668
01:44:22,174 --> 01:44:24,224
After Papa's death has there
been a singIe day...

1669
01:44:24,433 --> 01:44:26,900
a singIe day when the two
of you haven't fought?

1670
01:44:28,121 --> 01:44:30,552
Who wouId want to forge a bond
with these broken reIationships?

1671
01:44:31,077 --> 01:44:34,481
Who wouId want to marry me?
TeII me, who wouId want to marry me?

1672
01:44:37,166 --> 01:44:40,260
HeIIo... So you guys want
to marry into this famiIy?

1673
01:44:40,818 --> 01:44:43,877
Bad Idea! We are aII mad and we
wiII drive aII of you mad too!

1674
01:44:47,567 --> 01:44:50,069
PIease eat that big Iaddoo pIease

1675
01:45:12,263 --> 01:45:16,296
You Iove Aman and he's married

1676
01:45:18,489 --> 01:45:19,557
Why did you faII in Iove, Naina?

1677
01:45:20,507 --> 01:45:21,680
Don't be siIIy mom.

1678
01:45:22,524 --> 01:45:24,469
If I'd known earIier,
wouId I have faIIen in Iove?

1679
01:45:26,212 --> 01:45:26,864
No

1680
01:45:31,081 --> 01:45:31,982
Now why are you crying?

1681
01:45:32,299 --> 01:45:34,173
Because I know you weII

1682
01:45:35,395 --> 01:45:36,924
You wiII never be abIe
to take this rejection

1683
01:45:37,379 --> 01:45:38,659
You wiII never be happy

1684
01:45:40,614 --> 01:45:42,382
You wiII never faII in Iove again

1685
01:45:43,188 --> 01:45:44,575
You wiII never marry

1686
01:45:45,380 --> 01:45:48,048
You wiII be aII aIone...
just Iike me- yes.

1687
01:45:48,336 --> 01:45:51,216
What do you mean 'yes'?
How can you agree with me?

1688
01:45:51,432 --> 01:45:53,614
You shouId be consoIing me...
You shouId be teIIing me, ''No Mom...''

1689
01:45:53,832 --> 01:45:58,481
''I wiII be happy... I wiII Iove again...
I wiII marry!'' Says yes.

1690
01:45:58,702 --> 01:45:59,425
How can I consoIe?

1691
01:46:00,233 --> 01:46:03,186
I Iove him, mamma,
I reaIIy Iove him.

1692
01:46:10,911 --> 01:46:13,827
He harasses me, he makes fun of me

1693
01:46:14,877 --> 01:46:16,406
Wherever I go, he foIIows me

1694
01:46:17,033 --> 01:46:18,492
And he eavesdrops on
everyone's conversations

1695
01:46:18,876 --> 01:46:21,794
But, I stiII Iove him.

1696
01:46:24,929 --> 01:46:27,182
Why do I Iove him?

1697
01:46:28,025 --> 01:46:32,225
Why is this happening to me?
What shouId I do?

1698
01:46:34,355 --> 01:46:35,707
Everything wiII be aIright!

1699
01:46:36,965 --> 01:46:43,180
I know... Our angeI is
Iooking at us even now

1700
01:46:44,618 --> 01:46:47,251
He wiII make sure that your
Iife is fiIIed with Iove again!

1701
01:46:48,516 --> 01:46:55,879
He wiII teach you to Iove again...
You wiII Iove again...

1702
01:46:58,358 --> 01:47:00,754
Come on my chiId.
Let's go home

1703
01:47:05,975 --> 01:47:09,096
<i>Even Aman wanted to fill
my life with love again...</i>

1704
01:47:09,977 --> 01:47:10,841
<i>with Rohit's love</i>

1705
01:47:12,237 --> 01:47:12,925
<i>But Rohit...</i>

1706
01:47:45,283 --> 01:47:47,016
The Iady's name is CamiIIa.

1707
01:47:49,944 --> 01:47:52,446
CamiIIa! It's a very IoveIy name.

1708
01:47:52,658 --> 01:47:56,762
You must reaIIy Iove this CamiIIa!
Because this neckIace is very expensive.

1709
01:47:57,180 --> 01:47:58,318
It's $20,000.

1710
01:48:00,623 --> 01:48:01,276
How much?

1711
01:48:01,806 --> 01:48:03,750
$5.- Okay, Great.

1712
01:48:04,450 --> 01:48:07,438
Oh! not the red ones pIease.
They disturb me.

1713
01:48:07,755 --> 01:48:10,150
How's the yeIIow?
- Okay, much better.

1714
01:48:10,886 --> 01:48:14,597
Thank you, nice meeting you,
Bye, take care.

1715
01:48:18,364 --> 01:48:20,272
I was about to phone you.

1716
01:48:22,956 --> 01:48:24,415

1717
01:48:25,252 --> 01:48:28,512

1718
01:48:28,730 --> 01:48:31,231

1719
01:48:31,583 --> 01:48:33,113
So... are we meeting this evening?

Of course. Can't wait.

Where's Rohit?

1727
01:49:03,377 --> 01:49:04,479
He's gone with a girI!

1728
01:49:05,151 --> 01:49:07,722
With a girI!
- GirI... GirI...

1737
01:49:39,483 --> 01:49:47,371
Oh my god! yes...yes....yes...

1738
01:49:49,745 --> 01:49:52,247
Ladies & GentIemen.
He just proposed to me.

1739
01:49:52,631 --> 01:49:55,206

1740
01:49:55,416 --> 01:49:58,854
Come on get up Rohit.

CongratuIations!

1748
01:50:41,331 --> 01:50:43,963

01:50:44,288 --> 01:50:46,956
Her name is CamiIIa...
And she onIy Ioves your money

1750
01:50:47,802 --> 01:50:51,406
Money? How can you be so uncooI?
-You are a bIoody fooI!

1751
01:50:51,974 --> 01:50:53,290

carried away by you this time

1752
01:50:53,505 --> 01:50:56,530
Ok... Just go and teII her...
CamiIIa darIing...

1753
01:50:56,741 --> 01:51:01,461
I don't want my father's money.
I want to make my Iife on my own...

1754
01:51:01,680 --> 01:51:04,942
I want to stand up on my own
two feet... WiII you stand by me?

1755
01:51:05,508 --> 01:51:09,434
That is sick!
That is cheap...

1756
01:51:09,647 --> 01:51:12,077
I wiII never say that...
never... never... never

1757
01:51:12,498 --> 01:51:15,309
CamiIIa darIing...
I don't want my father's money

1758
01:51:15,769 --> 01:51:17,322
I want to take my Iife on my own

1759
01:51:17,681 --> 01:51:20,777
I want to stand up on my own
two feet... wiII you stand by me?

1760
01:51:23,386 --> 01:51:24,974
I'm ready to marry you!

1761
01:51:28,291 --> 01:51:31,208
Just Iisten to me... PIease....

1762
01:51:33,720 --> 01:51:37,017
I don't understand this... How did
you Iet go of Naina so easiIy?

1763
01:51:37,230 --> 01:51:39,733
Look at you...

1764
01:51:39,944 --> 01:51:42,341
Ladies & GentIeman...
WeIcome to LaIaIand.

1765
01:51:42,554 --> 01:51:45,222
Rohit Ioves Naina...
Naina doesn't Iove Rohit

1766
01:51:45,441 --> 01:51:46,684
She Ioves Aman

1767
01:51:46,900 --> 01:51:49,569
But Aman teIIs Rohit that he
shouIdn't Iet go of Naina so easiIy

1768
01:51:49,787 --> 01:51:52,420
So basicaIIy Aman is... insane!

1769
01:51:52,640 --> 01:51:54,716
Who are you taIking to?
I haven't gone insane

1770
01:51:55,005 --> 01:51:56,215
Your brains have been dispIaced

1771
01:51:56,642 --> 01:51:57,851
Naina hasn't faIIen in Iove with me

1772
01:51:58,241 --> 01:52:00,600
She just thinks that she has
faIIen in Iove with me.

1773
01:52:00,816 --> 01:52:02,511
She thinks... Ah... she thinks!

1774
01:52:02,728 --> 01:52:04,082
Now what is 'she thinks'
supposed to mean?

1775
01:52:04,642 --> 01:52:06,967
Man... I am a new entry
into her Iife

1776
01:52:07,182 --> 01:52:08,152
I just Iaughed a IittIe with her,
made her smiIe...

1777
01:52:08,363 --> 01:52:09,049
and she thought she is in Iove with me

1778
01:52:09,720 --> 01:52:11,214
WhiIe you have known her for years...

1779
01:52:11,425 --> 01:52:12,670
she takes you for granted...

1780
01:52:13,165 --> 01:52:14,967
now she is not going to dream
that you are in Iove with her

1781
01:52:15,286 --> 01:52:18,891
Now just forget aII this friendship
nonsense and show her some Iove man...

1782
01:52:19,390 --> 01:52:21,264
whether she says 'yes' or
'no' Ieave it to her

1783
01:52:21,513 --> 01:52:23,529
But at Ieast give her a choice...
You keep running after that ChameIi...

1784
01:52:23,739 --> 01:52:25,292
LiIy... - CamiIIa...

1785
01:52:26,277 --> 01:52:30,511
But you know CamiIIa has sexy Iegs.
- What Iegs man...

1786
01:52:30,730 --> 01:52:33,125
Shut up! We are taIking about Naina
- Sorry focus on Naina.

1787
01:52:33,861 --> 01:52:34,549
Naina!

1788
01:52:35,496 --> 01:52:37,121
Naina's beautifuI eyes!

1789
01:52:38,035 --> 01:52:39,209
Naina's IoveIy face

1790
01:52:40,158 --> 01:52:41,401
Naina's fury...

1791
01:52:41,619 --> 01:52:42,414
Naina's Iove...

1792
01:52:42,942 --> 01:52:44,079
Naina's smiIe...

1793
01:52:44,297 --> 01:52:45,649
Whenever she does, that is

1794
01:52:46,210 --> 01:52:47,906
Naina's hair... when she
ties them up Iike this

1795
01:52:48,124 --> 01:52:50,234
ActuaIIy I Iike her hair aII Iet down

1796
01:52:57,236 --> 01:52:58,695
Why are you saying, Naina?

1797
01:52:59,880 --> 01:53:01,647
For you... I'm married!

1798
01:53:03,149 --> 01:53:04,289
And what if you weren't?

1799
01:53:05,027 --> 01:53:07,283
Then I wouIdn't Iet go of her.
I'm not an idiot Iike you

1800
01:53:07,674 --> 01:53:10,342
I am taIking about Naina.

1801
01:53:10,873 --> 01:53:14,347
You are right! Now what do I do?
- You don't do anything

1802
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:15,663
Now whatever has to be done,
I wiII do

1803
01:53:15,952 --> 01:53:18,347
You just do as I say
I have a pIan...

1804
01:53:19,012 --> 01:53:22,487
six days and girI in your face...
Just six days.

1805
01:53:22,942 --> 01:53:25,124
Wow! But why six days?

1806
01:53:25,969 --> 01:53:27,914
Because I don't work on Sundays

1807
01:53:35,119 --> 01:53:35,628
DAY ONE

1808
01:53:37,901 --> 01:53:39,810
Naina waits for me everyday here at 6 p.m.

1809
01:53:40,684 --> 01:53:42,178
We go together from here to the cIass

1810
01:53:44,893 --> 01:53:46,696
But you won't go with her today
- Why?

1811
01:53:47,327 --> 01:53:48,430
Because I say so

1812
01:53:49,031 --> 01:53:51,357
Is your pIan to bring us together
or throw us apart?

1813
01:53:51,988 --> 01:53:53,340
I have a theory about girIs

1814
01:53:53,866 --> 01:53:56,438
The more you run after them,
the more they wiII run away from you

1815
01:53:56,650 --> 01:53:59,604
But if you run away from them they wiII
be confused and wiII run after you...

1816
01:53:59,815 --> 01:54:01,439
to find out the reason for their confusion

1817
01:54:01,693 --> 01:54:03,911
And we have to take advantage of such
a confusion of a confused girI...

1818
01:54:04,442 --> 01:54:05,652
Even I'm confused!

1819
01:54:06,043 --> 01:54:07,810
That you are... from chiIdhood!
That can't be heIped...

1820
01:54:08,025 --> 01:54:10,038
but trust me... do as I say

1821
01:54:10,563 --> 01:54:11,393
Put this into your ear

1822
01:54:13,104 --> 01:54:14,598
Put it where?- In your ear

1823
01:54:18,007 --> 01:54:19,846
This device wiII be attached
to the phone...

1824
01:54:20,478 --> 01:54:22,102
so that I can speak to you constantIy

1825
01:54:22,321 --> 01:54:24,954
Whatever I say or do... you shouId do
Got it?

1826
01:54:28,548 --> 01:54:32,368
Rohit come in pIease.
- AIfa Bravo CharIie, I read you.

1827
01:54:32,584 --> 01:54:34,455
I have reached the coIIege

1828
01:54:34,738 --> 01:54:37,835
Good SoIdier, Now reIax at ease...
at ease.

1829
01:54:38,287 --> 01:54:39,009
Loosen your tie

1830
01:54:39,713 --> 01:54:40,958
For God's sake, change your waIk

1831
01:54:41,452 --> 01:54:44,858
WaIk?- Yes, your waIking styIe.
I mean cooI waIk, you know?

1832
01:54:54,359 --> 01:54:55,224
Have you reached the cIassroom.
- Yes

1833
01:54:56,306 --> 01:54:59,116
So stop shaking, idiot!
Can you see Naina?

1834
01:55:00,479 --> 01:55:02,424
Yes...- Shut your mouth, duffer

1835
01:55:02,707 --> 01:55:04,544
Go and sit next to her
but don't speak to her

1836
01:55:05,525 --> 01:55:07,576
Where were you? I was waiting
for you for over haIf hour

1837
01:55:07,784 --> 01:55:10,880
You are always Iate.
I just don't understand this.

1838
01:55:12,585 --> 01:55:14,874
Don't Iook at her... Don't...
Look up... Iook down...

1839
01:55:15,196 --> 01:55:18,527
Look to the side... Not her side,
idiot... the opposite side!

1840
01:55:18,846 --> 01:55:22,074
I'm taIking to you... what has
happened to you? Are you iII?

1841
01:55:24,412 --> 01:55:25,313
Look at her angriIy

1842
01:55:25,525 --> 01:55:26,354
Look at me.

1843
01:55:26,568 --> 01:55:28,964
Not so subteIy... Over act...
Look at her angriIy

1844
01:55:29,179 --> 01:55:30,008
Look at me, Rohit

1845
01:55:30,987 --> 01:55:31,746
Okay, very good.

1846
01:55:31,961 --> 01:55:33,384
Now, put your finger into your nose

1847
01:55:34,674 --> 01:55:36,750
Just kidding, soIdier.
Catch you at the base bye.

1848
01:55:40,066 --> 01:55:40,860
DAY TWO.

1849
01:55:42,501 --> 01:55:44,161
And don't forget, cooI waIk

1850
01:55:50,571 --> 01:55:51,815
Don't sit near Naina

1851
01:55:52,658 --> 01:55:56,963
Then where do I sit...?
- Near some sexy girI...

1852
01:56:00,556 --> 01:56:01,526
Oh my god! It's Gita.

1853
01:56:03,234 --> 01:56:06,708
Okay, Hi.- It's my birthday.
Oh, Birthday.

1854

1855
01:56:09,217 --> 01:56:12,442
Hi, It's my birthday.
- Hi, Happy birthday.

1856
01:56:16,345 --> 01:56:17,106
Now push your cheek ahead

1857
01:56:21,878 --> 01:56:22,637
Did Naina see that?

1858
01:56:26,018 --> 01:56:33,668
Now hoId her...HoId her tight...
Hug her... Don't Iet her go

1859
01:56:34,573 --> 01:56:35,059

1860
01:56:35,757 --> 01:56:36,446

DAY THREE

1862
01:56:40,591 --> 01:56:42,251
HeIIo Rohit!- Yes, come in Aman.

1863
01:56:42,748 --> 01:56:44,099
Rohit!- Yes. - Idiot.

1864
01:56:47,132 --> 01:56:47,926
Do you want to say something?

1865
01:56:48,592 --> 01:56:50,015
You won't attend cIass today
- Ok....

1866
01:56:51,167 --> 01:56:52,791
No... I want to go to the cIass today

1867
01:56:54,751 --> 01:56:58,084
Your pIan is aII rubbish! I haven't
spoken to Naina since three days...

1868
01:56:58,576 --> 01:56:59,750
Even I haven't spoken
to Naina for three days

1869
01:56:59,968 --> 01:57:01,948
But you are not the one
in Iove with her, stupid!

1870
01:57:02,403 --> 01:57:06,364
Don't worry. Now when Naina caIIs
you... you wiII not speak to her

1871
01:57:07,029 --> 01:57:08,096
No... I wiII speak to her.
- No, you won't

1872
01:57:08,315 --> 01:57:11,648
Yes I wiII... - No, you won't

1873
01:57:14,578 --> 01:57:16,521
Naina, I Iove you...

1874
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:19,340
Sorry. It's your mother

1875
01:57:19,794 --> 01:57:22,820
See? It's mothers who always run to rescue
Mummy, I Iove you.

1876
01:57:23,380 --> 01:57:24,802
Sorry, yes Mom...
I have taken the medicine

1877
01:57:25,014 --> 01:57:27,231
Why shouId I Iie?
Mummy, Bye... Bye...

1878
01:57:28,979 --> 01:57:29,560
And what is that?

1879
01:57:30,092 --> 01:57:31,100
Those are two fingers what eIse?

1880
01:57:31,344 --> 01:57:33,526
Sorry man, I asked.
See...? Naina didn't caII.

1881
01:57:33,815 --> 01:57:36,173
You don't worry. I know Naina

1882
01:57:36,666 --> 01:57:38,954
She wiII wake up from her bed, she
wiII pick up the phone to caII...

1883
01:57:39,170 --> 01:57:40,486
but her ego wiII stop her

1884
01:57:40,700 --> 01:57:46,050
She must be missing you.
So she wiII get up again...

1885
01:57:46,267 --> 01:57:47,998
She wiII pick up the phone again.
She wiII curse you twice...

1886
01:57:48,388 --> 01:57:50,189
Idiot...Moron...
- She'II definiteIy make a caII.

1887
01:57:54,615 --> 01:57:56,204
I don't beIieve you...
that must be your mother again!

1888
01:57:56,528 --> 01:57:57,843
Don't make fun of my mother!
- What did I say?

1889
01:57:58,581 --> 01:58:02,364
Aman, give it to me.
- No...never.

1890
01:58:04,773 --> 01:58:05,566
Oh my god!

1891
01:58:07,556 --> 01:58:08,977
What happened to her
- I don't know

1892
01:58:10,513 --> 01:58:12,280
Oh no.

1893
01:58:12,808 --> 01:58:14,195
Today you wiII speak to Naina

1894
01:58:14,546 --> 01:58:17,014
And you wiII say what
we discussed... Understand?

1895
01:58:17,886 --> 01:58:20,103
Hi Naina..- Hi Lee.
Thank you for your notes.

1896
01:58:20,321 --> 01:58:21,186
You are weIcome.

1897
01:58:23,069 --> 01:58:24,100
DAY FOUR

1898
01:58:26,930 --> 01:58:28,805
One second... one second...
How far can you run from me darIing?

1899
01:58:29,019 --> 01:58:30,228
Leave my hand... Just Ieave my hand

1900
01:58:30,445 --> 01:58:31,833
I don't know what's happened to you,
I think you have gone mad

1901
01:58:32,322 --> 01:58:35,416
For the past three days, I have been
trying...Where were you, Rohit?

1902
01:58:35,626 --> 01:58:37,156
When I needed a friend,
where were you?

1903
01:58:37,366 --> 01:58:39,834
I'm tired... I'm reaIIy
tired of being your friend

1904
01:58:40,324 --> 01:58:41,331
What?- What? What?

1905
01:58:41,575 --> 01:58:42,405
When you want to Iaugh, it's Rohit...

1906
01:58:42,585 --> 01:58:43,071
when you want to cry, it's Rohit

1907
01:58:43,280 --> 01:58:44,488
But when you have to Iove,
it's someone eIse!

1908
01:58:44,705 --> 01:58:46,365
It's not going to work anymore, right?

1909
01:58:46,584 --> 01:58:49,015
Are you aIright, Rohit?
- No, you Iisten to me, Okay.

1910
01:58:49,506 --> 01:58:50,643
We are friends, right?
- Yes...

1911
01:58:50,862 --> 01:58:53,258
So a very inteIIigent man has said that

1912
01:58:53,471 --> 01:58:54,894
the first step to Iove is friendship...

1913
01:58:55,453 --> 01:58:56,284
and the Iast step is friendship too

1914
01:58:57,889 --> 01:58:59,063
It's the middIe that's Ieft

1915
01:59:01,857 --> 01:59:05,330
Take a step Naina and
you wiII find your path

1916
01:59:07,804 --> 01:59:10,899
Think....Naina... think...

1917
01:59:12,916 --> 01:59:15,061
And to think I give you ...

1918
01:59:18,448 --> 01:59:19,586
my entire Iife

1919
01:59:24,709 --> 01:59:25,848
<i>Wonder what Rohit meant</i>

1920
01:59:27,179 --> 01:59:28,981
<i>That day l felt Rohit had
ceased to be my friend...</i>

1921
01:59:29,439 --> 01:59:30,374
<i>he had become something else</i>

1922
01:59:31,458 --> 01:59:35,385
<i>And what that 'something else' was...
l didn't know... Didn't know...</i>

1923
01:59:37,057 --> 01:59:37,674
DAY FIVE.

1924
01:59:49,336 --> 01:59:51,518
Hi Sweetie, how are you doing?

1925
01:59:55,285 --> 01:59:57,502
This is for you

1926
01:59:58,554 --> 01:59:59,241
What's in it?

1927
02:00:00,223 --> 02:00:04,707
My heart... Just kidding!

1928
02:00:10,103 --> 02:00:10,720
Nice dress.

1929
02:00:14,418 --> 02:00:15,590
''The red in here is the coIour of my heart''

1930
02:00:16,331 --> 02:00:17,683
''On you I'm sure it wiII Iook smart''

1931
02:00:17,965 --> 02:00:19,174
''It's not a gift... it's something
I don't know what to caII...''

1932
02:00:19,635 --> 02:00:21,330
''Isn't Subhash Ghai's fiIm
caIIed 'TaaI'? ''

1933
02:00:22,870 --> 02:00:24,982
''P.S. Sorry couIdn't think
of a rhyming fourth Iine''

1934
02:00:27,045 --> 02:00:27,766
''Love Rohit''

1935
02:00:29,722 --> 02:00:30,373
DAY SIX

1936
02:00:32,330 --> 02:00:32,983
What's this?

1937
02:00:34,417 --> 02:00:36,884
''I'm not a poet.
O damseI, I surrender...''

1938
02:00:37,443 --> 02:00:40,290
''Cos the next Iines of the song
I do not remember!''

1939
02:00:41,062 --> 02:00:42,272
What's going on?

1940
02:00:43,114 --> 02:00:44,644
Look, I need something from you.
- What?

1941
02:00:45,792 --> 02:00:50,548
This... Dance cIasses... saIsa
- SaIsa?

1942
02:00:51,151 --> 02:00:53,853
It's Mom and Dad's
wedding anniversary...

1943
02:00:54,072 --> 02:00:57,060
and I have to perform an item?
Don't ask me, okay?

1944
02:00:57,272 --> 02:01:00,816
Look, I can't do that 'Dandia' Okay.

1945
02:01:01,202 --> 02:01:03,279
So I thought... why not SaIsa?

1946
02:01:04,019 --> 02:01:06,724
I need a partner to join the cIasses

1947
02:01:07,323 --> 02:01:13,683
Since you are going to be my Iife
partner, why not start now? - NO

1948
02:01:15,813 --> 02:01:17,865
I'm just asking for a chance to dance
not to fIirt with you.

1949
02:01:18,074 --> 02:01:24,989
No Rohit, Shut up... this is the
Iast thing I wiII do for you

1950
02:01:28,021 --> 02:01:30,595
My boy...Those were very fine Iines

1951
02:01:31,047 --> 02:01:32,293
Cos they were from here, man!

1953
02:01:40,163 --> 02:01:40,992
FooIing man

1954
02:01:42,077 --> 02:01:44,992
Dog...Dog...See you Iater man.

1955
02:01:46,491 --> 02:01:49,862
I'm not a poet damseI,

1956
02:03:14,220 --> 02:03:19,500
''Life's changing every moment''

I Iove you.

2011
02:08:34,313 --> 02:08:37,304
I reaIIy Iove you, Aman.
- Thank you, Rohit.

2012
02:08:37,516 --> 02:08:39,212
Just Iook at me... - Why?

2013
02:08:39,428 --> 02:08:41,052
What do you see?
- Nothing... Ok

2014
02:08:41,271 --> 02:08:42,242
Just Iook at this!

2015
02:08:42,628 --> 02:08:43,280
Why shouId I?
I don't want to see that

2016
02:08:43,497 --> 02:08:47,103
Just see this... Look at my tie.
- You were saying this, I thought...

2017
02:08:47,568 --> 02:08:49,121
Naina has given me this tie

2018
02:08:50,107 --> 02:08:51,459
With a IoveIy Iove Ietter

2019
02:08:51,673 --> 02:08:57,091
Love Ietter, very good.
- You...you are something eIse, man.

2020
02:08:57,306 --> 02:08:58,766
If it wasn't for you,
there wouId be nothing

2021
02:08:58,977 --> 02:09:01,088
I know...I know...
You are a genius.- Since birth.

2022
02:09:01,307 --> 02:09:03,452
You are inteIIigent, briIIiant...

2023
02:09:03,672 --> 02:09:04,882
You shouId write a book

2024
02:09:05,134 --> 02:09:06,414
Six days and girI in your face!

2025
02:09:06,631 --> 02:09:08,847
Even I was thinking
aIong those Iines

2026
02:09:09,064 --> 02:09:10,239
Anyway, whatever I did
for you is ok

2027
02:09:10,457 --> 02:09:12,508
But even you are quite Iucky.
Because for you, I...

2028
02:09:14,806 --> 02:09:17,546
What did I do?
I didn't do anything...

2029
02:09:17,761 --> 02:09:21,021
It's aII you...
It's because of you... your Iove...

2030
02:09:21,238 --> 02:09:23,185
You...

2031
02:09:24,022 --> 02:09:27,626
You are so great! You don't even
want to take the credit for it

2032
02:09:30,109 --> 02:09:32,221
Listen to me for once. Okay.

2033
02:09:32,720 --> 02:09:34,771
The truth is that it's because
of you Naina is in my heart...

2034
02:09:34,979 --> 02:09:36,330
in my heartbeat... in every breath

2035
02:09:36,544 --> 02:09:38,134
and in my room...
- And in my room!

2036
02:10:01,939 --> 02:10:04,678
Naina wait, Iet go of me...- Listen...
Let go of me...what?

2037
02:10:04,895 --> 02:10:06,246
Must have been fun... right?

2038
02:10:06,459 --> 02:10:08,156
Must have been great fun
breaking my heart

2039
02:10:08,894 --> 02:10:10,424
Six days and girI in your face

2040
02:10:11,677 --> 02:10:14,595
Both of you shouId be
given an award! Fantastic, Rohit.

2041
02:10:14,809 --> 02:10:17,903
Listen to me...ya...
- No, Iisten to me.

2042
02:10:18,114 --> 02:10:20,687
I thought of you as a friend
and poured my heart out to you

2043
02:10:21,071 --> 02:10:23,644
And what did you do?
ToId him everything!

2044
02:10:24,027 --> 02:10:26,766
And he... He, who wants
to pIay God to everyone...

2045
02:10:26,984 --> 02:10:31,290
decided that since he couIdn't
Iove me, he wouId find Iove for me...

2046
02:10:32,550 --> 02:10:34,243
and he knocked on your door

2047
02:10:34,461 --> 02:10:37,200
And toId you that your friendship is
not just friendship, it's Iove

2048
02:10:37,419 --> 02:10:38,250
And you got convinced?

2049
02:10:38,810 --> 02:10:39,984
Rohit, what kind of a person are you...?

2050
02:10:40,202 --> 02:10:43,118
who doesn't know his own heart...
understand his own feeIings?

2051
02:10:43,332 --> 02:10:45,206
I Iove you Naina...
and that's the truth

2052
02:10:45,420 --> 02:10:47,637
No! That's not the truth...

2053
02:10:47,856 --> 02:10:51,638
The truth is that you have broken
my heart! You have hurt me...

2054
02:10:53,073 --> 02:10:56,333
I know that I didn't have
Iaughter in my Iife before..

2055
02:10:56,551 --> 02:10:58,838
didn't have happiness...
But at Ieast I had a friend!

2056
02:10:59,681 --> 02:11:01,898
But today you have
taken that away from me...

2057
02:11:02,638 --> 02:11:03,467
Both of you

2058
02:11:04,550 --> 02:11:07,648
Just Iisten, Naina...- No.

2059
02:11:13,247 --> 02:11:14,491
No! I don't want to hear anything

2060
02:11:14,986 --> 02:11:16,447
I don't want to
understand anything

2061
02:11:16,728 --> 02:11:18,780
For God's sake, just Ieave me aIone!

2062
02:11:23,336 --> 02:11:23,988
Just a sec...

2063
02:11:26,118 --> 02:11:29,723
Naina, I wish I couId
teII you how much I Iove you

2064
02:11:29,944 --> 02:11:36,159
One sec. Wait, I Iove you
very much...

2065
02:11:40,554 --> 02:11:44,336
And then it says...
I Iove you & ...

2066
02:11:46,294 --> 02:11:50,077
And when I cIose my eyes I see you

2067
02:11:52,554 --> 02:11:55,295
When I open my eyes,
I Iong to see you

2068
02:11:57,425 --> 02:11:58,077
Even when you are not near me,

2069
02:11:58,294 --> 02:11:59,646
I feeI you in everything I'm surrounded by...

2070
02:11:59,860 --> 02:12:02,600
Every second... every minute...
aII the time...

2071
02:12:05,426 --> 02:12:08,521
my eyes search
onIy for my dear Naina

2072
02:12:10,122 --> 02:12:14,083
CaII it Iove, madness or
just my heartbeats...

2073
02:12:15,338 --> 02:12:16,170
it's the same thing for me

2074
02:12:19,339 --> 02:12:20,691
A Iot of peopIe have Ioved before...

2075
02:12:21,600 --> 02:12:24,341
but my Iove stands apart
from aII of them because...

2076
02:12:25,080 --> 02:12:25,908
they don't have you

2077
02:12:30,123 --> 02:12:31,476
I can never forget you Naina

2078
02:12:32,211 --> 02:12:35,305
I don't want to forget you

2079
02:12:36,037 --> 02:12:39,642
You are mine and I wiII Iove you forever

2080
02:12:40,210 --> 02:12:43,756
I wiII Iove you tiII I die...
and even after that!

2081
02:12:53,428 --> 02:12:59,299
AII this is written in this diary...
Rohit has written aII of it

2082
02:13:00,037 --> 02:13:01,214
How can he hurt...?

2083
02:13:03,170 --> 02:13:05,385
And you have such
a bad handwriting

2084
02:13:35,518 --> 02:13:37,736
Aman... aII this... I didn't...

2085
02:13:37,953 --> 02:13:39,484
You didn't write...
but I said it

2086
02:13:40,042 --> 02:13:42,614
If you had to write it,
you wouId write the same thing

2087
02:13:42,824 --> 02:13:45,812
So I said what was in your heart...
what's the big deaI? Right?

2088
02:13:46,092 --> 02:13:49,842
And girIs Iike aII this...
I have done it a Iot

2089
02:13:50,824 --> 02:13:51,310
Are you okay?

2090
02:13:52,911 --> 02:13:56,030
I just want to make a caII.
Excuse me!

2091
02:14:23,522 --> 02:14:25,575
Sorry Mom It's Iate, Iet's go

2092
02:14:28,218 --> 02:14:30,790
I want to say something
to you... just Iisten

2093
02:14:32,045 --> 02:14:39,826
Naina, to sustain IifeIong...

2094
02:14:40,915 --> 02:14:44,354
every reIationship has to
have strength aIong with Iove

2095
02:14:47,001 --> 02:14:52,242
Your Papa Ioved us a Iot,
but he was a weak man

2096
02:14:54,480 --> 02:14:55,726
He Ieft us aII and went away...

2097
02:14:57,611 --> 02:15:02,547
didn't even for a moment think
what wouId become of us after him

2098
02:15:05,787 --> 02:15:10,342
But Rohit... Rohit is not weak...

2099
02:15:11,179 --> 02:15:12,981
he Ioves you a Iot

2100
02:15:15,526 --> 02:15:18,100
How easy it is for you
to say Papa was weak!

2101
02:15:19,874 --> 02:15:24,523
And Rohit... taking someone
eIse's heIp to attain your Iove...

2102
02:15:24,743 --> 02:15:27,863
isn't that a sign of weakness?
TeII me Mama...

2103
02:15:31,353 --> 02:15:33,052
To attain his Iove
he sought heIp...

2104
02:15:33,963 --> 02:15:35,137
what's wrong with that?

2105
02:15:37,615 --> 02:15:43,829
Look, I stiII maintain Rohit
is not a weak man

2106
02:15:46,137 --> 02:15:51,309
He knows you Iove someone eIse
and yet he is wiIIing to accept you

2107
02:15:53,268 --> 02:15:57,230
That's strength, my chiId.
That's Iove.

2108
02:16:00,921 --> 02:16:06,615
If you reject his Iove today,
it wiII be a girI's decision...

2109
02:16:10,836 --> 02:16:16,361
and tomorrow when you repent it,
it wiII be a woman's regret!

2110
02:16:28,052 --> 02:16:28,705
HeIIo.

2111
02:16:29,097 --> 02:16:30,970
Hi Rohit.- Hi Naina.

2112
02:16:31,183 --> 02:16:31,835
Where are you?

2113
02:16:33,793 --> 02:16:35,488
In the office

2114
02:16:35,879 --> 02:16:37,054
Wanted to speak to you

2115
02:16:37,271 --> 02:16:39,632
ActuaIIy it's kind of private.

2116
02:16:40,055 --> 02:16:42,201
Private & confidentiaI...J. Kapur?...

2117
02:16:43,707 --> 02:16:45,925
Oh My God! It's Frankie's Ietter

2118
02:16:46,142 --> 02:16:50,791
Didi... Guess what?
- Now what's happened?

2119
02:16:51,012 --> 02:16:54,795
CongratuIation! Fantastic!

2120
02:16:55,011 --> 02:16:57,752
Thanks, Aman... But how did you know?
I haven't even opened it

2121
02:16:57,969 --> 02:16:59,321
What did you not open?
- Don't even open it...

2122
02:16:59,534 --> 02:17:00,885
Aman wiII run away.
- No, I won't

2123
02:17:01,099 --> 02:17:04,776
Just see... It's Frankie's Ietter!
- Yes... yes

2124
02:17:06,492 --> 02:17:08,888
What happened?- Naina wants to meet Rohit

2125
02:17:09,100 --> 02:17:11,151
FinaIIy and they're going for
the first meeting.

2126
02:17:12,927 --> 02:17:17,753
And Frankie's sent a Ietter
- Yes that's fantastic news.

2127
02:17:17,970 --> 02:17:20,887
I'm going to get her ready myseIf!
I've got the perfect white dress.

2128
02:17:21,100 --> 02:17:24,196
And do you know what?
- Yes... Frankie has sent a Ietter!

2129
02:17:24,405 --> 02:17:26,278
And now we'II go...& eat something.

2130
02:17:26,493 --> 02:17:28,710
But how did that happen?
I'm just a sexy genius.

2131
02:17:28,927 --> 02:17:30,456
Oh that you are!

2132
02:17:35,189 --> 02:17:36,019
Give to me...It's Frankie's Ietter...

2133
02:17:36,232 --> 02:17:37,584
Letter is mine give it to me.
- One minute.

2134
02:17:39,188 --> 02:17:40,541
Let's see what the cooI dude says

2135
02:17:47,885 --> 02:17:51,039
It's... not Frankie's Ietter!

2136
02:17:55,713 --> 02:17:59,151
AIright everybody, she's coming...
- Come on...

2137
02:18:06,496 --> 02:18:08,368
Oh She's Iooking so pretty!

2138
02:18:08,755 --> 02:18:12,124
Just puII this up a bit...
Lord protect you from eviI eye!

2139
02:18:12,756 --> 02:18:14,453
Now enough... May I Ieave?

2140
02:18:22,846 --> 02:18:24,197
I Iike her hair open

2141
02:18:27,367 --> 02:18:30,283
Your hair...- What?

2142
02:18:41,454 --> 02:18:42,463
Iooks better open

2143
02:18:46,324 --> 02:18:46,811
Go

2144
02:19:30,327 --> 02:19:33,423
AII this...?- PIease.

2145
02:19:35,720 --> 02:19:38,293
I know you don't have
Iove to give me today

2146
02:19:39,894 --> 02:19:44,544
But I'm sure someday you
wiII have... I'm sure

2147
02:19:45,980 --> 02:19:47,678
And I wiII wait for that day...

2148
02:19:48,589 --> 02:19:51,329
because I know that day
wiII come... for sure

2149
02:19:52,764 --> 02:19:56,796
But for today, pIease
have faith in my Iove

2150
02:19:57,947 --> 02:20:02,632
Because I know it's enough
for both of us, Naina...

2151
02:20:05,809 --> 02:20:09,936
I wanted to give these fIowers
to you earIier too... I couIdn't

2152
02:20:11,374 --> 02:20:15,607
PIease don't refuse them today...
or eIse they wiII wiIt!

2153
02:20:18,678 --> 02:20:22,284
Naina... Naina... Naina...

2154
02:20:24,071 --> 02:20:24,793
Marry me!

2155
02:20:51,030 --> 02:20:52,902
HeIIo...Yeah...Yeah...

2156
02:21:04,943 --> 02:21:05,772
She said 'yes'!

2157
02:21:19,900 --> 02:21:22,925
Everybody...I need a hug
come on everybody.

2158
02:22:00,078 --> 02:22:02,544
<i>The next step was to convince
Karsanbhai and Sarlaben...</i>

2159
02:22:04,252 --> 02:22:07,857
<i>which wasn't very difficult.
After all...</i>

2160
02:22:08,495 --> 02:22:10,193
It's just geography!

2161
02:22:10,861 --> 02:22:12,390
Come... Come... JuIieben!

2162
02:22:12,600 --> 02:22:15,340
Jennifer!- Jennifer who?

2163
02:22:17,644 --> 02:22:18,475
It's aIright.

2164
02:22:19,732 --> 02:22:21,427
Why don't you have something?
- Yes... Sure

2165
02:22:21,644 --> 02:22:23,696
Listen... just pass me the Cock!

2166
02:22:24,775 --> 02:22:26,826
Coke, Dad. PIease...
- Yes, yes. Coke

2167
02:22:27,036 --> 02:22:28,909
So everything is fixed!

2168
02:22:29,122 --> 02:22:32,908
Engagement and our wedding
anniversary wiII be on the same day

2169
02:22:33,471 --> 02:22:35,522
And two days Iater wiII be
the wedding... is it aIright?

2170
02:22:35,732 --> 02:22:36,632
As you say!

2171
02:22:38,864 --> 02:22:40,394
As you wish.

2172
02:22:40,604 --> 02:22:42,192
And the funny thing, Jamnaben is...

2173
02:22:42,690 --> 02:22:44,908
You know. It's Jennifer
- Yes... Jenniferben...

2174
02:22:45,125 --> 02:22:47,520
there's this famous decorator
from Paris...

2175
02:22:47,907 --> 02:22:52,285
who is coming and at the same time
he wiII decorate my hoIe!

2176
02:22:53,125 --> 02:22:54,999
No...I have a very big hoIe! Isn't it?

2177
02:22:55,212 --> 02:22:57,086
Very big.- HaII

2178
02:22:58,516 --> 02:23:02,823
Now Iook PateIji... I Ieave aII
the detaiIs of the wedding upto you

2179
02:23:03,909 --> 02:23:07,587
I am just happy that we got
such a good boy

2180
02:23:09,649 --> 02:23:14,818
I just miss my son!
- Very sad.

2181
02:23:15,387 --> 02:23:16,289
Rohit toId us...

2182
02:23:17,822 --> 02:23:19,519
What happened?- Heart attack!

2183
02:23:20,778 --> 02:23:23,874
Oh, heart attack.

2184
02:23:24,083 --> 02:23:25,781
Just waiting for Naina
and Shiv to settIe down...

2185
02:23:26,172 --> 02:23:28,044
then I can peacefuIIy
Ieave for Chandigarh!

2186
02:23:28,258 --> 02:23:29,288
And what about Gia?

2187
02:23:29,509 --> 02:23:30,649
She is not ours!- Dadi.

2188
02:23:31,702 --> 02:23:35,830
No, no, Gia is as much ours
as Naina is

2189
02:23:38,381 --> 02:23:44,145
And my husband didn't die
of a heart attack...

2190
02:23:45,512 --> 02:23:46,793
he commited suicide

2191
02:24:04,434 --> 02:24:06,059
Why did you have to
teII them the truth?

2192
02:24:06,904 --> 02:24:09,051
You cannot base new
reIationships on a Iie

2193
02:24:09,270 --> 02:24:10,657
You couIdn't handIe
oId reIationships

2194
02:24:10,871 --> 02:24:12,185
How wiII you know
how to handIe new ones?

2195
02:24:12,400 --> 02:24:14,417
ReIationships are not handIed.
They are maintained

2196
02:24:14,628 --> 02:24:15,837
But what wouId you know about them?

2197
02:24:16,054 --> 02:24:16,741
Now Iisten my dear daughter-in-Iaw...

2198
02:24:17,722 --> 02:24:21,125
I wiII onIy be your daughter-in-Iaw
the day Gia is your grand daughter

2199
02:24:21,339 --> 02:24:24,080
Gia was not my grand daughter
and she wiII never be!

2200
02:24:24,298 --> 02:24:25,199
BIood is bIood after aII!

2201
02:24:25,411 --> 02:24:28,255
That's it! I don't want to hear anymore!

2202
02:24:28,471 --> 02:24:30,831
Why? When you are so fond
of saying the truth...

2203
02:24:31,045 --> 02:24:35,113
Iearn to Iisten to it too.
Gia is not my grand daughter

2204
02:24:36,193 --> 02:24:40,048
She is not a part of this famiIy
She is just a burden...

2205
02:24:40,263 --> 02:24:44,498
a burden which you thrust
on this famiIy by adopting her

2206
02:24:45,585 --> 02:24:49,749
A burden which took away
aII the happiness in the famiIy...

2207
02:24:49,969 --> 02:24:53,265
took away peace...took away my son...

2208
02:24:55,847 --> 02:24:59,356
I hate her... I hate her...
I hate that nasty IittIe...

2209
02:24:59,568 --> 02:25:00,219
NO!

2210
02:25:12,510 --> 02:25:15,285
We are stiII paying
for my son's mistakes

2211
02:25:15,500 --> 02:25:17,198
The first mistake he made
was marrying you

2212
02:25:17,415 --> 02:25:18,836
The second was adopting that girI

2213
02:25:19,049 --> 02:25:20,330
He made a third one too

2214
02:25:20,546 --> 02:25:24,186
You? Who the heII are you to
interfere in our famiIy matters?

2215
02:25:24,405 --> 02:25:29,517
No one... Just a voice that shouId
have reached you a Iong time ago

2216
02:25:30,632 --> 02:25:33,728
A truth that you shouId
have reaIized Iong ago

2217
02:25:34,388 --> 02:25:36,961
PIease Jenny, pIease Iet me

2218
02:25:38,843 --> 02:25:41,343
Since you are harping on the truth,
I wouId Iike to teII you a truth too

2219
02:25:42,148 --> 02:25:45,822
About your son's
iIIicit reIationship...

2220
02:25:47,991 --> 02:25:49,829
which he hid from aII of you

2221
02:25:50,495 --> 02:25:52,367
But he couIdn't hide its resuIt

2222
02:25:53,068 --> 02:25:54,492
Do you know the name of the resuIt?

2223
02:25:54,772 --> 02:25:57,584
Aman pIease.- Jenny, it's aIright.

2224
02:25:59,991 --> 02:26:01,449
The resuIt was Gia...

2225
02:26:04,096 --> 02:26:04,582
Gia!

2226
02:26:05,382 --> 02:26:07,185
who couId not be accepted
by her own mother...

2227
02:26:07,609 --> 02:26:10,597
but was accepted by
your daughter-in-Iaw, Jenny...

2228
02:26:12,687 --> 02:26:15,748
was brought into this house
by your daughter-in-Iaw, Jenny...

2229
02:26:16,898 --> 02:26:20,123
Jenny... who couId have seen the face
of the other woman in Gia's face...

2230
02:26:21,315 --> 02:26:23,887
who couId have seen her husband's
mistakes in that face...

2231
02:26:24,758 --> 02:26:27,355
But what she chose
to see were those incompIete eyes...

2232
02:26:29,489 --> 02:26:31,397
and she chose to compIete those
eyes by fiIIing them with Iove...

2233
02:26:32,898 --> 02:26:34,036
your daughter-in-Iaw Jenny

2234
02:26:46,152 --> 02:26:49,034
Your son wouId have understood
her hurt and her anger...

2235
02:26:50,117 --> 02:26:51,849
but he couIdn't understand
her acceptance

2236
02:26:52,620 --> 02:26:56,299
Jenny's strength reminded him
every minute of his own weakness...

2237
02:26:58,048 --> 02:27:02,601
and it was this feeIing that
took his Iife... Not Jenny

2238
02:27:09,386 --> 02:27:10,396
<i>Dear Jennifer</i>

2239
02:27:11,404 --> 02:27:15,711
<i>l know in these last six years
l have only enquired about Gia...</i>

2240
02:27:16,484 --> 02:27:18,039
<i>never about you</i>

2241
02:27:19,024 --> 02:27:25,416
<i>But today, in this last letter
l want to thank you..</i>

2242
02:27:26,746 --> 02:27:29,342
<i>Thank You Jennifer. Thank You</i>

2243
02:27:30,050 --> 02:27:33,869
<i>Women are built to forgive the
mistakes that their husbands make...</i>

2244
02:27:34,850 --> 02:27:40,164
<i>but very few women have the courage
to accept the mistake...</i>

2245
02:27:40,868 --> 02:27:44,580
<i>and shower love to such a degree
that it doesn't remain a mistake</i>

2246
02:27:45,390 --> 02:27:51,119
<i>You accepted Gia when l, her mother,
couldn't accept her</i>

2247
02:27:51,756 --> 02:27:54,080
<i>And for this l will always
remain indebted to you</i>

2248
02:27:55,130 --> 02:27:57,312
<i>They say that when
a man makes a mistake...</i>

2249
02:27:57,808 --> 02:28:00,654
<i>he also possesses the ability
to pay the price for it</i>

2250
02:28:01,287 --> 02:28:06,849
<i>But Jennifer, all these years you have
paid a price for a mistake...</i>

2251
02:28:07,409 --> 02:28:08,723
<i>that was not yours
in the first place</i>

2252
02:28:09,774 --> 02:28:11,162
<i>And all that because of me</i>

2253
02:28:12,454 --> 02:28:14,148
<i>lf you can, please forgive me</i>

2254
02:28:15,583 --> 02:28:16,899
<i>l'm sorry Jennifer.</i>

2255
02:28:17,425 --> 02:28:18,530
<i>l'm really sorry</i>

2256
02:28:19,584 --> 02:28:22,988
<i>l caused you a lot of painl
l'm sorry.</i>

2257
02:28:36,942 --> 02:28:38,365
He was a good man!

2258
02:28:40,455 --> 02:28:48,033
It was just a mistake!
Just a mistake!

2259
02:28:48,247 --> 02:28:49,741
Yes, my chiId... Yes...

2260
02:28:51,620 --> 02:28:58,821
He was a good man!
He was a good man, Mother...

2261
02:29:02,267 --> 02:29:09,357
He was a good man Naina!
Just a mistake!

2262
02:29:13,918 --> 02:29:18,471
<i>And finally Gia's perfect family
was complete... complete</i>

2263
02:29:20,597 --> 02:29:22,150
<i>All the distances were bridged...</i>

2264
02:29:23,032 --> 02:29:26,059
<i>and we started praying together...</i>

2265
02:29:27,381 --> 02:29:29,040
<i>like one big happy familyl</i>

2266
02:29:29,817 --> 02:29:32,411
<i>The engagement preparations
had begun in full swingl</i>

2267
02:29:33,781 --> 02:29:37,326
<i>Jean De Bon... the famous decorator
from France had arrived...</i>

2268
02:29:37,711 --> 02:29:40,212

2269
02:29:41,120 --> 02:29:41,915
Drapes.

2270
02:29:43,415 --> 02:29:44,068
From the top.

2271
02:29:44,391 --> 02:29:53,915
Leaving aII the Iove of my famiIy
I have to go to my beIoved's Iand...

2272
02:29:54,129 --> 02:29:54,616
ExceIIent!

2273
02:29:54,826 --> 02:29:58,266
<i>And in Aman's mansion
there was chaosl</i>

2274
02:29:58,861 --> 02:30:00,319
<i>Oh Godl -Oh god!</i>

2275
02:30:00,530 --> 02:30:05,881
<i>God had heard Kantaben's prayers.
Rohit was getting married to a girl</i>

2276
02:30:09,331 --> 02:30:10,646
<i>Finally, the day of the engagement...</i>

2277
02:30:14,341 --> 02:30:19,619
<i>Gujarat opened its opulent doors for
Punjab in its characteristic splendour</i>

2278
02:30:32,881 --> 02:30:36,037
''One, two, three...
what a community!''

2279
02:30:36,291 --> 02:30:39,622
''The Shahs, the PateIs, the Mehtas..

2280
02:30:39,907 --> 02:30:43,241
''But who are we...?
- Yes, who are we?''

2281
02:30:45,056 --> 02:30:48,114
''G-U-J-J-U''

2401
02:42:20,724 --> 02:42:24,995
Priya, you were married earIier?
How come I was not invited?

2402
02:42:25,212 --> 02:42:26,040
Abhay shut up.

2403
02:42:26,637 --> 02:42:27,467
One is more than enough!

2404
02:42:28,517 --> 02:42:31,053
ActuaIIy, we met through Aman...

2411
02:42:45,630 --> 02:42:51,751
I can't beIieve that Aman
doesn't have very much time

2412
02:42:53,805 --> 02:42:56,544
But it's reaIIy nice to know that

2413
02:42:56,762 --> 02:42:57,793
In his Iast days.

02:43:04,240 --> 02:43:06,671
Aman doesn't have much time

2415

02:45:57,330 --> 02:45:59,238
Don't do that...okay? Enough

2429
02:46:00,463 --> 02:46:02,478
Doing that doesn't
change the truth, Aman.

2430
02:46:02,759 --> 02:46:05,189
Naina Ioves you, you Iove Naina...

2431
02:46:05,471 --> 02:46:06,858

of this Iove story?

2433
02:46:11,002 --> 02:46:13,706
and in a few months my heart
won't exist in the Iove story...

2434
02:46:15,072 --> 02:46:16,625
I wiII just be a memory

2435
02:46:17,228 --> 02:46:18,199
You are the reaIity, Rohit

2436
02:46:18,412 --> 02:46:20,319
I can face reaIity Aman

2437
02:46:21,019 --> 02:46:22,513
But I don't have the strength
to fight a memory, Aman

2438
02:46:22,724 --> 02:46:25,569
You don't have the strength?
How can you say that?

2439
02:46:26,688 --> 02:46:29,715
It means you don't Iove Naina
as much as I thought you do

2440
02:46:30,274 --> 02:46:31,553
Say you don't know how to Iove

2441
02:46:31,768 --> 02:46:34,093
What do you know?
What do you know about my Iove?

2442
02:46:35,143 --> 02:46:36,151
You know nothing!

2443
02:46:36,639 --> 02:46:39,450
Naina is my Iife,
my everything... my Iife

2444
02:46:39,666 --> 02:46:42,334
And you wiII Iet go
of your Iife so easiIy?

2445
02:46:43,457 --> 02:46:44,596
Why don't you
understand, Rohit?

2446
02:46:45,473 --> 02:46:47,003
Naina wiII get me
onIy to Iose me...

2447
02:46:47,213 --> 02:46:48,457
but Iosing you she wiII gain nothing

2448
02:46:49,369 --> 02:46:50,993
Neither Iove nor a great friendship!

2449
02:46:51,456 --> 02:46:55,559
Her Iove is yours. It beIongs to you

2450
02:46:56,813 --> 02:47:03,206
It just needs time. And that's
what I don't have... I don't have

2451
02:47:04,015 --> 02:47:06,862
Naina beIongs to you.
You cannot Ieave her

2452
02:47:07,078 --> 02:47:08,631
If not for you, if not for Naina...

2453
02:47:08,851 --> 02:47:10,651
at Ieast do this as a dying man's wish!

2454
02:47:11,284 --> 02:47:13,015
PIease fuIfiII my Iast wish, Rohit, pIease.

2455
02:47:13,231 --> 02:47:16,043
You can't Ieave Naina.
That's it! That's it!

2456
02:47:18,415 --> 02:47:20,182
What wouId you have done
if you were in my pIace?

2457
02:47:24,642 --> 02:47:31,558
I wish I was in your pIace.
I wish

2458
02:49:02,354 --> 02:49:04,986
You Iove me so much that you want

2459
02:49:05,380 --> 02:49:10,587
to Ieave behind Iove for me...
even after you go?

2460
02:49:13,798 --> 02:49:15,386
Even if it is someone eIse's?

2461
02:49:16,720 --> 02:49:25,093
Why did you do this?
Why do you Iove me so much?

2462
02:49:26,077 --> 02:49:31,676
I don't Iove you. I don't Iove you...

2463
02:49:33,520 --> 02:49:42,380
I don't Iove you, Naina...
I don't Iove you

2464
02:49:46,252 --> 02:49:52,158
I don't Iove you.
I don't Iove anyone

2465
02:50:08,759 --> 02:50:11,154
Why do you Iove me so much?

2466
02:50:33,490 --> 02:50:36,336
